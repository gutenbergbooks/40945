<h2 class="p2">PROLOGUE</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
THE MEETING IN THE FOREST</h3>

<p>Paul Cressingham, captain in Her Britannic
Majesty's army, had seen some active service, and
was therefore not unused to sleeping on the ground
at night wrapt in his military cloak. Nevertheless he
had a civilian weakness, if not for luxury, at least for
comfort, and much preferred a four-poster, whenever
the same was procurable.</p>

<p>At the time, however, when this story opens it seemed
likely that if he slept at all, his slumbers would have to
be <i>à la belle étoile</i>, for he found himself late at night
wandering in a deep pine-forest of Dalmatia.</p>

<p>Paul's regiment&mdash;the Twenty-fourth Kentish&mdash;had
its headquarters at Corfu; for his were the days when
the United States of the Ionian Isles formed a dependency
of the British Crown. His uncle, Colonel Graysteel,
was commander-in-chief of the forces stationed
there,&mdash;a fact which stood Paul in good, or possibly in
bad, stead, for thereby he was enabled to obtain more
relaxation than is consonant with the traditions of the
War Office, his furloughs being extremely numerous, and
spent chiefly in exploring odd corners of the Adriatic.</p>

<p>Colonel Graysteel growled occasionally at his nephew's
negligences. Having no children of his own, he had
adopted Paul as his heir. On parade there was no finer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
figure than Paul's,&mdash;tall, athletic, soldierly. With hair
of a golden shade and having a tendency to curl, with
soft hazel eyes that could look stern, however, at times,
and with graceful drooping moustache, he was first favorite
with the ladies of the English colony at Corfu,
especially as his elegance in waltzing was the despair of
all his brother-officers. He was an excellent shot, a
deadly swordsman, a dashing rider, a youth of spirit
and bravery. To one of this character much must be
forgiven, and the old colonel forgave accordingly.</p>

<p>Nevertheless when Paul one fine morning walked into
his uncle's villa at breakfast-time and requested furlough
for no other reason than a wish to explore the wilds of
Dalmatia, there was a slight outbreak of wrath on the
part of the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>"Another leave of absence? I don't believe you've
put in three months' service this year."</p>

<p>"Four months, five days," corrected the other amiably.</p>

<p>"The Commissioner's beginning to notice your vagaries."</p>

<p>"Hang the Commissioner," replied the young man,
irreverently. "Let him give me something worthy of
doing, and I'll do it. Get up a war, say against Austria
or Turkey, the latter preferred; show me the enemy and
you'll find me to the fore. But this playing at soldiers;
this marching and counter-marching; this inspection of
kit, and attendance at parade,&mdash;I'm growing wearied
of it. I'm rusting here,&mdash;I, whose motto is 'Action.'
Am I to remain for ever in these cursed malarial isles,
a mere drilling machine?"</p>

<p>"The drillings pay when comes the day," retorted the
colonel, so surprised at this betrayal into rhyme that he
repeated it. "And what's this new craze of yours for
Dalmatia? Wild outlandish place! Nobody ever goes
there."</p>

<p>"Precisely my reason for visiting it," returned Paul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
lunging with his sabre-point at a mosquito that had just
settled on a panel of the wall. "Why go where everybody
goes? My tastes run in the direction of the odd,
the romantic, the wild, the&mdash;anything that's opposed
to the common round of existence. I fancy I shall find
it in Dalmatia."</p>

<p>"You'll find yourself in the hands of banditti. That's
where you'll be. The mountains swarm with them. And
I'm damned if I'll pay your ransom," cried the colonel
with returning wrath, as he recalled the liberality and
frequency with which Paul drew upon his purse. "Remember
the case of young Lennox, and the severed ear
sent to his father in an envelope. Ten thousand florins!
That's what the old chap had to pay to get his son out
of the clutches of the infernal scoundrels, and never a
thaler has he been able to recover from the Austrian
Government. And now you would run yourself and
me into a similar noose!"</p>

<p>"Banditti won't fix my ransom at so high a rate. Besides,"
added Paul, critically contemplating the Damascene
inlaying of his sabre, "they've first got to take me."</p>

<p>"Well, if they'll fix it at what you're worth," said his
uncle, grimly, "I shall not object to the payment."</p>

<p>Ultimately Paul obtained the desired furlough by resorting
to his usual threat; he would sell his commission,
buy a string of camels, and spend the rest of his
life in trying to discover the sources of the Nile.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that a few days after this interview
young Captain Cressingham embarked on board
the Austrian Lloyd's steamer <i>Metternich</i>, bound for
Zara, the clean, well-built capital of Dalmatia, directing
his voyage to this city in order to renew old memories
with some former college-chums, who were about to pass
their summer holiday in its neighborhood.</p>

<p>Finding that he had anticipated the arrival of his
friends by a few days, Paul resolved to spend the interval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
in taking a pedestrian tour southward as far as Sebenico:
and accordingly he set off, without either companion or
servant, and wearing his uniform, partly because as a
soldier he was proud of it, partly because experience had
taught him that in these eastern regions a uniform inspires
respect in the minds of innkeepers, if not in those
of banditti.</p>

<p>He passed the first night of this journey at a wayside
hostelry.</p>

<p>At sunrise he resumed his course, walking amid picturesque
scenery&mdash;on the right the sparkling sea, on the
left glorious pine-clad mountains.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Paul, who had followed the post-road,
reached a point where it entered a magnificent
forest. As this wild-wood was just the sort of place
where banditti might be expected to lurk, Paul's first
impulse was to turn aside, and to take the more circuitous
way along the sea-beach.</p>

<p>"You fear!" a secret voice seemed to whisper: and
the reproach decided his route. Not even in his own eyes
would he be a coward.</p>

<p>This choice of a road was but a small matter, one might
think; yet it was to form the turning-point of his life.</p>

<p>He walked forward at a quick pace, and, with an eye
to a challenge from some outlaw of the forest, he kept
his hand constantly upon the butt of his revolver.</p>

<p>He did not meet with a bandit, however, but with a
bear&mdash;the first he had ever seen in a wild, free state.</p>

<p>The creature came shambling from the wood on one
side of the road a few yards in front of him, and there it
stood, with its eyes fixed upon the wayfarer, as if questioning
the right of man to invade these solitudes.</p>

<p>"An adventure at last!" murmured Paul, tingling
with excitement. "<i>Ursus Styriacus</i> from his size. Now
to emulate Hereward the Wake."</p>

<p>As previously stated Paul was an excellent shot, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
inasmuch as his revolver was six-chambered he had little
fear as to the result of the encounter.</p>

<p>The killing of a bear is the easiest thing in the world,
at least according to the theory set forth by a hunter
whom Paul had met the previous evening at the hostelry.</p>

<p>"If you fire at Bruin while he is on all-fours, you
waste powder and shot, for his tough shaggy sides are
almost impervious to bullets. You must face him at
close quarters, and when he rises on his hind legs to welcome
you with that hug which is his characteristic, then is
the time to aim at the vital parts. If the shots fail to take
effect, and you find yourself in his embrace, you simply
draw your knife, give the necessary stab, and the thing
is done."</p>

<p>The plan seems beautifully simple.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, Paul did not
have the opportunity of reducing the theory to practice;
for, as he slowly advanced, revolver in hand, and with
his eye alert to every movement of the bear, the latter
ambled off again into the wood.</p>

<p>Resolving to give chase, Paul turned aside from the
road. He would shoot that bear, bring back some fellows
from the inn to flay the animal, and present the skin
to his uncle.</p>

<p>But Colonel Graysteel was not destined to decorate his
smoking-room with a trophy of his nephew's valor, for
though Paul followed hard upon his quarry, its rate of
progress surpassed his own. In a few moments it had
passed from view, and all the shouting and random firing
on the part of Paul failed to provoke the return of the
animal.</p>

<p>"Talk no more to me of the spirit of bears," he muttered,
as he put up his weapon.</p>

<p>Paul turned to resume his journey in some vexation of
spirit&mdash;a feeling which did not diminish as he began to
realize that he had lost his bearings. All around him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
rose the lofty pines, obscuring his view of the road from
which he had been diverted by the chase of the bear.
There was nothing to indicate the way. He carried an
ordnance-map of the district, and the forest was marked
large upon it, but he was unable to tell what particular
point of the map corresponded with his own position at
that moment. Moreover, he was without a compass;
and, to add to his difficulty, the sun had set.</p>

<p>Seek as he would he could not find the road. Now and
again he shouted at the top of his voice, even at the risk
of attracting the notice of persons less friendly than charcoal-burners
or wood-cutters, but his cries met with no
response. The silence and solitude of the leafy vistas
around were more suggestive of the primeval back-woods
of the New World than of an European forest.</p>

<p>For several hours he walked, or rather stumbled along,
in the darkness, wandering this way or that, as blind
fancy directed, and haunted by the reflection that Bruin
might return with one of his <i>confrères</i>, eager to dine off
a too venturesome tourist.</p>

<p>He had given himself up as hopelessly lost, when he
came to a spot where the foliage above his head suddenly
lifted, revealing a sky of the darkest blue set with glittering
stars. This sky extending in a broad band far to the
left and far to the right proclaimed the welcome fact that
he had hit upon the road again.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch, and found that it was close
upon midnight. That infernal Bruin had delayed his
journey by six hours.</p>

<p>Even now he had no idea which way to turn for Sebenico,
till his eyes, roaming over as much of the sky as
was contained within his circle of vision, caught the sign
of Ursa Major.</p>

<p>"Poetic justice!" he smiled. "Misled by the earthly
bear, guided by the heavenly."
Knowing that Sebenico lay to the south, he accordingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
set his face in that direction with intent, on reaching the
first milestone, to ascertain from his ordnance-map the
position of the nearest village or inn.</p>

<p>He stepped forward briskly, and keeping a sharp lookout
soon came upon a milestone glimmering white upon
one side of the road. Kneeling down he struck a match&mdash;like
the revolver, a recent invention in 1845&mdash;and by
the faint glow learned that he was thirty miles from
Zara.</p>

<p>Taking out his map, together with the "Tourist's
Manual for Dalmatia," he proceeded to make a study of
both by the brief and unsatisfactory illuminations afforded
by a succession of lucifers.</p>

<p>"After to-night," he muttered, "I shall always carry a
small lantern with me; likewise a compass."</p>

<p>Now while Paul was kneeling there, intent upon book
and map, he received the greatest surprise of his life.</p>

<p>"Which way does Zara lie?"</p>

<p>The question was spoken in Italian&mdash;the common
language of Dalmatia&mdash;by a voice so soft and musical
that the like had never been heard by Paul.</p>

<p>When he had risen to his feet he stood mute with astonishment,
a passage from "Christabel" floating through
his mind,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"I guess 't was frightful there to see</p>
<p>A lady so richly clad as she&mdash;</p>
<p>Beautiful exceedingly!"</p>
</div>

<p>For, in truth, it <i>was</i> a lady that Paul saw standing before
him at midnight hour beneath the light of the stars
in the depth of the Dalmatian forest; and, like the lady of
the poem, she was both richly dressed and marvellously
beautiful&mdash;lovely as the soft beauty of a southern night;
with raven hair, and dusky eyes that seemed the mirrors
of a sweet melancholy. She wore a long Dalmatian
capote with the hood drawn over her head. The capote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
being partly open revealed a costume of the richest silk.
Decorated with curious gold brocade, and with a wealth
of chain-work and gems, this dress, though it might have
been pronounced bizarre by the more sober taste of Western
ladies, harmonized in Paul's judgment with the wild
oriental beauty of the wearer.</p>

<p>"Pardon me if I have startled you. Which way does
Zara lie?"</p>

<p>And the astounded Paul, usually full of assurance in
the presence of women, could do nothing on the present
occasion but simply stammer forth, while pointing to the
north,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is the road to Zara."</p>

<p>"I thank you, signor."</p>

<p>With a stately inclination of her head she drew her
capote more closely around her, and walked away in the
direction indicated by Paul as quietly and confidently as
if the lonely forest-road were the Boulevard des Italiens,
and the distant Zara a pretty toy-shop a few yards ahead!</p>

<p>Different people, different customs. Was it the habit
of young Dalmatian women to take solitary midnight
walks through bear-haunted forests?</p>

<p>Recovering from his surprise Paul hastened after her.</p>

<p>"Signorina, you cannot walk alone to Zara."</p>

<p>"And why cannot I walk alone to Zara?" said the
young lady, facing Paul and assuming a hauteur that had
a somewhat chilling effect upon his gallantry.</p>

<p>"Perils beset you&mdash;banditti, for example."</p>

<p>"With native Dalmatians the person of a woman is
held sacred. No one, not even a robber, will do me
hurt."</p>

<p>Subsequent inquiry on the part of Paul proved that the
lady had spoken correctly. Indeed he learned that if a
stranger travelling in this region were to place himself
under the escort of a woman, he would be free from
molestation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>This high standard of chivalry, curious among a people
otherwise barbarous, explained the lady's confidence and
fearlessness in approaching him.</p>

<p>"But, signorina," remonstrated Paul, "the way is so
long. Zara is thirty miles off. And you would walk that
distance on foot! Consider the fatigue."</p>

<p>"I can sit and rest, and when tired can sleep for a time
on the ground as I did last night. I <i>must</i> reach Zara,"
she added, with a shiver as of fear.</p>

<p>Her dress of jewels gave proof of her wealth, her voice
and manner of refinement. It was amazing, then, to hear
her talk of sleeping <i>al fresco</i> on the turf like a gipsy or a
soldier.</p>

<p>"I thank you, signor, but I do not require an escort."
So saying she walked away again with the dignity of a
princess, while Paul in his bewilderment gazed after her
retreating figure.</p>

<p>"Here's a mystery, forsooth! Who is she? What is
she? What lovely eyes! And what a witching face!
Now how should a fellow act in a case like this? Ought
I not to follow her?"</p>

<p>Paul had no wish to force his protection upon a young
woman averse to it, but the circumstances seemed to justify
him in exercising some sort of surveillance over her,
for though the Dalmatians might be such paladins as she
had represented, there were dangers other than those arising
from the malevolence of human beings&mdash;bears, for
example. If harm should befall her, then his would be
the blame for permitting her to go on her way alone. But
as she was opposed to his presence he shrank from walking
by her side. She might insist upon his retiring, and
refusal or obedience would be equally distasteful to him.
His course was clear; the protection must be exercised
from a distance, and without her knowledge.</p>

<p>Accordingly he followed in the wake of the young
woman, screening himself from a possible backward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
glance on her part by keeping within the covert of the
trees that skirted the roadside, and stepping out from
time to time to note her progress.</p>

<p>Her slow and halting pace gave clear indication that
she was worn with travelling, and half-an-hour had not
passed when Paul observed her swaying to one side as if
about to fall. Too tired to proceed farther, she turned to
a grassy mound beside the road and sat down, resting
her brow upon her hand, the very picture of languor and
despondency.</p>

<p>The sight of her helplessness moved Paul strangely.
No longer concealing himself, he walked boldly forward
in the centre of the road that she might observe his
coming.</p>

<p>"Signor, you are following me," she said, with a touch
of reproach in her voice.</p>

<p>"I plead guilty."</p>

<p>"Wishing to protect me from imaginary perils?"</p>

<p>"Imaginary! You may be safe from men, but have
you made a truce with the beasts? A huge bear crossed
this road a few hours ago."</p>

<p>The lady gave a start of fear. Paul saw his advantage
and pursued it.</p>

<p>"Signorina, I am an Englishman&mdash;a military officer,
as you see," he remarked, putting aside his cloak and revealing
his handsome uniform of dark blue adorned with
silver facings. "I do not ask who or whence you are;
but whether you be princess or peasant, I cannot let you
go on your way alone and unprotected."</p>

<p>She did not reply, and Paul continued in a somewhat
firmer tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You do wrong to repel me. You are too exhausted
to walk farther without aid."</p>

<p>"You speak the truth," she murmured. "I am faint.
I have eaten nothing for twelve hours."</p>

<p>Her tone went to Paul's heart, the more so as he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
nothing to offer her in the shape of food, for he had long
ago consumed his last morsel.</p>

<p>"You must think it strange," said the lady, after a
brief pause, "for a woman to be wandering in this hour
in such a spot."</p>

<p>"I do not press for confidences&mdash;only for permission
to conduct you to a place of safety."</p>

<p>"But learn the risk you run by so doing. It was not
from churlishness that I refused your escort just now.
Signor, I will be frank with you, believing that you will
not betray me. I have escaped from a convent, where I
was forcibly detained, and I fear pursuit by the Austrian
gendarmerie. Hence, by aiding me, you may come into
collision with the authorities. Why should I bring trouble
upon you? Now you understand my desire for Zara. I
hope to find there some English vessel. Once beneath its
flag I shall be safe."</p>

<p>"You fear pursuit? Then you require an arm for your
defence. So long as I can handle sword and pistol no
one shall carry you off against your will. Signorina,
you must come with me."</p>

<p>"And where would you take me?" she asked in a tone
that showed she was yielding.</p>

<p>"Not far from here, according to my guide-book, is a
path leading down to the sea. On the shore, which is distant
about a mile, stands a building, old but tenanted, and
called Castel Nuovo. This is the nearest human habitation,"
continued Paul. "Before meeting you I had intended
to try my fortune there. Now, suppose we go
together? As the Dalmatians are such respecters of
women they will not refuse you hospitality. Rest at this
castle for the night, and to-morrow you shall find an
easier way of reaching Zara than journeying thither on
foot."</p>

<p>The young lady was not long in coming to a decision.
A roof, food, and a bed, and these distant but a mile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
offered a more attractive prospect than supperless repose
on the dank turf of the dark bear-haunted wild-wood.
She rose to her feet, looked intently at Paul, and read in
his clear eyes the glance of a good conscience.</p>

<p>"Take me with you," she said, with the simplicity of a
child.</p>

<p>Paul bowed, and offered his arm, which she accepted.
The touch of her little hand thrilled him with a strange
pleasure.</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER II<br /><br />
THE CASTLE BY THE SEA</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>Walking onward a few paces they came to
the path mentioned in the guide-book.</p>

<p>Few words were spoken, for Paul, knowing
that his fair companion was tired, famished, and sleepy,
purposely refrained from conversation.</p>

<p>Once, however, the silence was broken, when the lady
timidly ventured to ask his name, which being given, he
in turn requested the like favor from her.</p>

<p>"I have been taught to call myself Barbara," was her
answer, which Paul could not but think was a somewhat
odd way of expressing herself.</p>

<p>Barbara! If he had not thought it a pretty name before,
he certainly thought it such now.</p>

<p>"And Barbara," he murmured, more to himself than
to his companion, "means 'strange.'"</p>

<p>"I fear you will find my character correspondent."</p>

<p>"But you have a second name?" smiled Paul.</p>

<p>"Presumably, but I am in ignorance respecting it, for
my parentage is unknown to me. Indeed, signor, it is
true," she added sadly. "I am a mystery to myself."</p>

<p>Her statement filled Paul with wonder, but though desirous
of learning her history he recognized that the time
was scarcely yet ripe to press for confidences.</p>

<p>The path traversed by them formed a gradual descent,
in parts so steep that Barbara would often have slipped
but for Paul's strong arm. The murmur of the sea was
now heard; a faint breeze blew coldly; finally emerging
from the wood, they found themselves on an open grassy
space shelving down to the beach.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>There, distant about a hundred yards, stood the building
that they sought&mdash;Castel Nuovo.</p>

<p>The retention of the epithet "Nuovo" was perhaps intended
as a joke on the part of the Dalmatians. Like the
rest of earthly things the castle must once have been new,
but that once, judging by appearances, was a long time
ago. The greater part of the edifice was in ruins, the
stars glimmering through the vacant window spaces
and through the gaps that yawned in the ivy-mantled
walls.</p>

<p>A massive, square built tower perched on a rock that
overhung the sea, seemed the portion likeliest to be tenanted,
if tenanted at all, for signs of human presence were
wanting. Neither light nor sound came from it.</p>

<p>Silent and ghostly in the cold starlight rose the gray
tower, the sea splashing with melancholy murmur at the
foot of the crag.</p>

<p>The brief notice contained in the guide-book&mdash;"Castel
Nuovo, an old mansion, residence of the Marquis Orsino"&mdash;did
not suggest a place like this, a place seeming
to be desolated by the curse of some past tragedy; and as
Paul contemplated the scene, a feeling of misgiving stole
over him,&mdash;a misgiving which found reflection in Barbara's
face.</p>

<p>Seating his companion upon a fallen column, Paul
went forward to reconnoitre. Crossing the grass-grown
pavement of what had once been a stately loggia, he
mounted the mossy fractured steps leading to the door of
the tower. On the lintel was sculptured, "Marino Faliero,
1348"&mdash;proof that the castle dated from the days
when the Venetians held sway in Dalmatia.</p>

<p>No sooner had Paul rapped upon the massive oaken
door than a terrible din arose from within. His summons
had startled into wakefulness a menagerie of dogs, and
these, judging by their deep bass, brutes of the largest
size.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>A casement high above the portal opened immediately,
and an old man's voice cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that you, Master?"</p>

<p>The question was spoken in Romaic, a language with
which Paul had become familiar by reason of his residence
in Corfu.</p>

<p>He directed his eyes upward, but the speaker was invisible.
Familiar perhaps with the attacks of banditti, he
was too cautious to expose his person as a target for a
pistol-shot.</p>

<p>Stepping back, the better to be heard, and speaking in
Romaic, the better to be understood, Paul explained his
object in knocking, withholding the fact, however, that
the lady with him had escaped from a convent, lest it
should dispose the old man to decline so dangerous a
fugitive.</p>

<p>"You cannot stay here," was the answer, when Paul
had finished speaking.</p>

<p>"I will pay you, and that handsomely, for the trouble
we give."</p>

<p>"It's not a question of money. This house is not
mine, and I cannot open it to whom I will. I have received
strict orders from the Master to admit no one
during his absence. If he should return and find me
entertaining strangers, I should suffer."</p>

<p>"Your master, whoever he may be, never meant that
you should turn away at midnight a young lady exhausted
by a twelve hours' wandering in the forest without food.
I ask not for myself, but for her. It is but for a single
night."</p>

<p>"A single hour would be too long."</p>

<p>Paul stood dismayed by the old man's churlishness.
He pictured Barbara's look of distress on announcing
that he had brought her on a bootless errand.</p>

<p>"You a Greek," he cried, "to refuse hospitality to an
Englishman, whose uncle fought for Greece&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>This appeal wrought a remarkable change in the old
man.</p>

<p>"What do you say you are?"</p>

<p>"An Englishman, nephew of Colonel Graysteel, commandant
of the British forces at Corfu, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An Englishman! Why the devil didn't you say so
before? I took you for a damned Austrian. And you
are the nephew of old 'Fighting Graysteel'? I was with
him at Missolonghi. Wait. I'll be down in a moment.
Hi, Jacintha, Jacintha," he added, addressing some one
within. "Get up, or I'll throw something at your head."</p>

<p>The old man withdrew from the casement, and Paul
concluded that he was coming downstairs, for the baying
of the dogs gradually ceased; there were sounds suggestive
of the idea that he was kicking them into some place
of safety.</p>

<p>"Jacintha?" thought Paul. "The old fellow's wife,
daughter, or servant? Whoever she may be, I am glad
for the young lady's sake that a woman lives here."</p>

<p>Footsteps were now audible in the passage. A little
panel in the upper part of the door slid aside revealing
an iron grating, behind which appeared a man's face set
in a square of light.</p>

<p>"No tricks with me. Now, mylordos, if you are what
you say you are, speak to me in English, for though I
don't talk the language myself I understand it when
spoken by others."</p>

<p>"Open the door, and give me some supper&mdash;" began
Paul.</p>

<p>"Ah! you're an Englishman, all over," interrupted
the other with a dry chuckle. "The first thing he thinks
of is his belly."</p>

<p>And the inmate, apparently satisfied with this credential
of nationality, swung open the great iron-studded door
and revealed himself.</p>

<p>He was a little man, and though past seventy years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
age, his form had lost little of the elasticity and strength
of youth. His thin curved nose was extremely suggestive
of the beak of an eagle, a resemblance increased by
his bright piercing eyes. His hair was white and flowing,
and his moustaches were of such a length that he had tied
them together at the back of his head.</p>

<p>His attire was gorgeous in the extreme, and he was
evidently very proud of the fact. He wore an open jacket
that was a perfect marvel of silk, velvet, and rows of
silver buttons; a white fustanella or kilt glittering with
embroidery of gold; and gaiters and slippers rich with
the same decoration. Altogether he was one of the
strangest creatures that Paul had ever beheld.</p>

<p>In one hand he carried a yataghan, and in the other a
lighted lamp, and he bowed low with theatrical grace.</p>

<p>"Since you are an Englishman, enter. Welcome, ten
thousand welcomes," he cried, waving his sparkling yataghan
around, as if inviting Paul to take entire possession
of the castle. "Every Englishman is my brother, for
did not your countrymen fight for the liberation of
Greece? Can we ever forget Navarino? You see before
you the friend, the companion-in-arms of General Church
and Lord Cochrane. You must have heard your uncle
talk of me,&mdash;Lambro the Turcophage, with whose name
Ottoman mothers still frighten their children, by telling
them how Lambro, whenever food ran short in the camp,
never hesitated to roast and eat his Turkish prisoners.
Ah!" Like a ghoul he smacked his lips at the memory
of those repasts. "Yes, to me, and to men like me,
Greece owes the freedom that she now enjoys. I should
be great to-day, and hold high office under King Otho:
but what am I? What you see. The custodian of an old
ruin. This is national gratitude, mylordos. It is thus
that Hellas rewards those who have shed their blood for
her."</p>

<p>Paul immediately recognized in the speaker one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
class called Palicars, men who had fought for the independence
of Greece in the twenties; in their youth half
soldiers and half brigands, but always full of patriotism
and bold as lions against the Turk; in old age too often
apt to be garrulous, boastful, vain.</p>

<p>Muttering some words of gratitude for the proffered
hospitality, Paul immediately flew off for Barbara, whom
he found asleep. In a state of weariness she had rested
her arm on a stone balustrade, pillowed her cheek on her
sleeve, and without intending it had fallen asleep in that
attitude.</p>

<p>"Fie, signorina," said Paul with chiding smile, as he
gently roused her. "Sleeping in the open air! Do you
court malaria? Come, there is better rest for you in yon
tower, where you will not be the only lady. Our host is
a somewhat queer character, but&mdash;'any port in a storm,'
as our English proverb has it."</p>

<p>He assisted her to rise, and helped her across the dilapidated
loggia, and up the steps to the entrance of the hall
where Lambro stood waiting to receive them.</p>

<p>But no sooner had the old Palicar obtained a clear
view of Barbara than his eyes almost started from their
sockets. His shaking hand dropped the lamp, and the
hall was plunged into sudden darkness. With the ejaculation
of "Kyrie eleison" the warrior, who was wont to
boast that he had fought in a hundred battles, fled at the
sight of a young maiden's face.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor he recovered himself, and
shouted, "Jacintha, Jacintha, come down."</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said a voice at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Matter enough," replied Lambro, grasping the
woman's shoulders and whispering in her ear. "The
dead have returned to life. Walk to the door, pick up
the lamp, re-light it, and look at the lady that the Englishman
has brought with him."</p>

<p>Jacintha did as bidden. The lamp, re-kindled, showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
her as a little fair-haired woman of subdued demeanor,
her face retaining traces of former good looks.</p>

<p>She cast one glance at Barbara, and immediately gave
a strange gasp.</p>

<p>"In God's name," she murmured, "who are you?"</p>

<p>"A hard question," returned Barbara, with a touch of
bitterness in her voice, "seeing that I myself cannot answer
it."</p>

<p>This reply seemed to enhance Jacintha's fear. She
stood mutely staring at Barbara, who began to feel something
of resentment at the woman's strange manner.</p>

<p>"I will depart if you wish it," she said, turning away
with quiet dignity, though her heart sank within her at
the thought of passing the night out of doors.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no. Pardon me, my lady, if I seem rude,"
replied Jacintha, assuming an humble manner, and stepping
forward as if to intercept Barbara's departure.
"Do not go. We shall be glad if you will stay. Stay
here as long as you will&mdash;at least&mdash;that is&mdash;till&mdash;till&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Till the Master returns," chimed in Lambro, "and
then&mdash;well, it's his rule to have no strangers here."</p>

<p>He had apparently plucked up his courage, for he had
come forward to the entrance again, where he and Jacintha
stood staring curiously, first at Barbara, then at
each other.</p>

<p>"You seem to know me," said Barbara, "though I do
not think that you can ever have seen me before to-night."</p>

<p>Receiving no reply, she glanced at Paul as if seeking an
explanation from him, who had none to give, for he was
as much perplexed as Barbara herself to account for the
singular behavior of this couple.</p>

<p>"At first sight of you," began Lambro, "we thought&mdash;But
no matter what we thought; we see now we were
wrong."&mdash;He cast at the woman a glance which Paul
interpreted as a warning for her to be reticent, and continued:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
"Now, Jacintha, show our guests the way upstairs.
The nephew of the man who fought for Greece
shall have no cause to complain of our hospitality."</p>

<p>"A queer couple," whispered Paul to Barbara, "but
trustworthy, I believe. I think you will be safe here."</p>

<p>Barbara, almost ready to sink to the ground with
fatigue, had no other course than to accept the shelter
of Castel Nuovo, however strange her entertainers; and
accordingly still resting upon Paul's arm, she followed
Jacintha up the staircase, while Lambro, having locked
the door, brought up the rear.</p>

<p>"Your wife?" Paul asked of him and referring to
Jacintha.</p>

<p>"She answers the purpose," replied Lambro. "We've
done without a priest so far. She's mine because I
bought her. Five hundred beshliks she cost me in the
slave-mart of Janina. A deal of money, a great deal of
money," continued the old fellow, wincing as if he had had
a tooth drawn. "I'm doubtful whether I've had the value
of it. I could have bought a lovely young Circassian at
the price. But since she was warranted to be a splendid
nurse and an excellent cook, I took her as a helpmeet for
my old age."</p>

<p>Paul trusted that Barbara did not understand Romaic,
for the old Palicar's society was not exactly of the sort
that a matronly duenna would have chosen as suitable for
a young maiden.</p>

<p>The interior of Castel Nuovo formed a pleasant and
striking contrast with its dilapidated exterior. The apartment
to which the visitors were conducted was stamped
with an air of wealth and dignity,&mdash;lofty, composed of
dark oak, and furnished with stained-glass casements,
blazoned in their centre with the Winged Lion of St.
Mark. The roof was richly fretted; the pictures painted
on the panelling of the walls were in a fine state of preservation.
On the wide tesselated hearth beneath a beautifully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
carved mantelpiece were pine logs disposed as for
a fire. To these Jacintha applied a match, and soon a
blaze sprang up, so bright as to render any other light
superfluous.</p>

<p>"The Master's dining-hall," remarked Lambro.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, my lady," said Jacintha, observing
Barbara embarrassed with the fastenings of her capote.</p>

<p>She assisted in untying the hood, and having removed
the cloak, seated Barbara in a comfortable arm-chair by
the fire.</p>

<p>Despite the Romaic costume worn by Jacintha, and the
golden coins twisted in her hair, Paul had no difficulty in
fixing her nationality.</p>

<p>"You are an Englishwoman?" he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am," was her reply, accompanied by a
submissive little curtsey.</p>

<p>A few words on her part sufficed to give her history.
Nurse in the service of an English doctor at Constantinople,
she had, when returning home, been captured by
Turkish pirates, and carried to Janina for sale, where
she was purchased by Lambro, and brought to Castel
Nuovo. Paul's ears tingled at the thought of an Englishwoman
being sold in an Albanian slave-mart. He wondered
whether she knew that she was now living in a free
country. Her real name was Winifred Power, but Lambro
would persist in calling her Jacintha.</p>

<p>It so happened that Paul was well acquainted with her
native town, inasmuch as his school-days had been passed
in its neighborhood. His allusions to places with which
both were familiar drew tears to the woman's eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah! do not talk of home," she said. "Every week I
can see from the windows here the steamer from Trieste
on its way to England; a few days' sail only, and yet as
impossible for me to reach as the stars."</p>

<p>"You're better off here," growled the old Greek. "I
bought you, and by God I'll keep you. You are not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
leave me till I&mdash;I&mdash;die&mdash;" He winced as if not liking
the prospect presented by the last word.&mdash;"You have
promised as much. I have treated you better than any
Turk would. You live in a castle with fine dresses and
plenty to eat and drink; and when I'm a&mdash;gone you'll
have my savings, and can then go back to England.
What more do you want?"</p>

<p>"Shall I be permitted to leave here after your death?"
asked Jacintha, darting a strange look upon Lambro,
who frowned, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is to prevent you? What nonsense you talk!
Why don't you ask our guests what they'll have for
supper?"</p>

<p>"What would my lady like?" inquired Jacintha turning
to Barbara, and enumerating the contents of her
larder.</p>

<p>"You are very good," smiled Barbara. "Anything
will do for me."</p>

<p>"Except, of course, roast Turk," said Paul, turning to
Lambro. "We must draw the line at that."</p>

<p>The Turcophage grinned and withdrew in company
with Jacintha; and as they called no servant to their aid,
Paul concluded, and rightly, that these two were the sole
tenants of the castle.</p>

<p>Paul had now a better opportunity than heretofore for
observing his fair companion as she sat by the hearth, the
bright firelight playing over her silken attire with its
shimmer of chain-work and jewels. Her figure was beautifully
shaped; her features were of pure, classic type,
as clear and delicate as if sculptured from alabaster.
There was something peculiarly noble in the pose of her
head, which disposed Paul to the belief that when the
mystery of her origin became solved, it would be found
that she was of high birth.</p>

<p>She had spread out her hands to the fire, and with her
face upturned to Paul, she said with charming <i>naïveté</i>,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>"I am so glad that you insisted upon me accompanying
you, for this is certainly more cheerful than the
dark forest."</p>

<p>The light of gratitude sparkling in her soft dusky eyes
completely captivated Paul. He began to think that it
would be a pleasant thing if she would always smile so
upon him, and upon none other.</p>

<p>"Our new friends," he remarked, "are evidently expecting
visitors, and those&mdash;two in number&mdash;to judge
from the cutlery." He pointed to the dining-table and
its snowy cloth set with Majolica-ware, cut-glass, and
silver. "The Master and his wife I presume. Unpleasant
for us if they should arrive to-night, and should
object to the proceedings of their hospitable seneschal."</p>

<p>Lambro and his partner now entered, bringing in a
repast.</p>

<p>Barbara and Paul drew to the table. The humble
Jacintha acted as waitress and seemed to take pleasure
in the office.</p>

<p>Though Barbara ate but sparingly, her companion
amply atoned for any deficiencies on her part; and when
Lambro, going down to the castle cellar, returned with
a bottle of delicious maraschino, and a box containing
cigars of ambrosial flavor, Paul's satisfaction was
complete.</p>

<p>Lambro having called for his chibouque, perched himself
upon a chair and sat cross-legged upon it in oriental
fashion, while Jacintha at his command took a live coal
from the fire by aid of the tongs, and applied it to the
bowl of his pipe. Then the old Palicar puffed away in
placid contentment while Jacintha went off to prepare a
room for Barbara.</p>

<p>"Those cigars," Lambro presently remarked, addressing
Paul, "have never paid Austrian duty. Whence do I
procure them? From the sea,&mdash;my constant friend. A
toast, a toast," he cried, raising his glass of maraschino.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
"Here's to the storm-fiend, and may he never cease to
send us rich flotsam and jetsam. The dress I wear," he
added, patting his gay costume with pride, "comes from
the body of a drowned compatriot. If the signorina requires
a new dress we can supply her with one as rich as
that she now has. No, I am not a wrecker," he continued,
as if in answer to Paul's suspicions. "I simply
take the gifts the waves send me, and they send them
pretty frequently on this wild rocky coast. Sometimes it
is a Turkish vessel that goes to pieces on the reef out
yonder," he went on, nodding in the direction of the sea.
"Jacintha and I can hear their cries, but we are unable
to help them. I would not help them if I could," he exclaimed
with a fierce flash of energy, and taking the pipe
from his mouth. "Are not the Turks the enemies of
Greece? When I hear their shrieks rising above the
sound of the storm&mdash;A-a-h!" He finished the sentence
with a smack of his lips.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to imagine any being more
weird than this little Greek, as he sat there cross-legged,
tricked out in the finery of the dead, his eye glittering
wildly, and his moustaches tied at the back of his head.</p>

<p>Paul deemed it advisable on Barbara's account to give
a different turn to the conversation.</p>

<p>"This must have been a grand old castle when entire,"
he said. "The property, is it not, of the Italian Marquis
Orsino?"</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Lambro, with a shake of his head.
"The marquis sold it seven years ago to my present
Master&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My guide-book is evidently not up to date."</p>

<p>"Though," added Lambro, "the sale was kept a
secret."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"All the Master's ways are secret."</p>

<p>"May one ask his name?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"He has forbidden me to reveal it."</p>

<p>Paul, though conscious that he was treading on delicate
ground, could not repress his further curiosity.</p>

<p>"Where does he live when not here?"</p>

<p>"He has never told me."</p>

<p>"What is his nationality?"</p>

<p>"That is equally a mystery to me."</p>

<p>Paul's interest in the Master increased, and as Lambro
did not seem to resent his questioning, he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How often does he visit this place?"</p>

<p>"It may be once only in the year, it may be twice or
thrice."</p>

<p>"I gather from your first words when I knocked at the
door, and also from the previous state of this table, that
you are expecting him at the present time?"</p>

<p>"Expecting him!" echoed Lambro. "I am always
expecting him. He never gives warning of his coming,
either by letter or messenger. A loud knock of the door,
and there he is! He may arrive to-night, he may not
arrive for six months. But present or absent the larder
must always be full, and the dining-room and the bedroom
ready for his immediate reception. A hard man is
the Master."</p>

<p>"And how long do his visits last?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon the mood of his companion."</p>

<p>"His companion? Do you mean his wife?"</p>

<p>"His wife?" repeated Lambro, with a peculiar laugh.
"The Master is a bachelor and will always remain such.
He is a member of a peculiar brotherhood pledged to the
repudiation of women."</p>

<p>"What is the object of his visits?"</p>

<p>But Lambro was not disposed to be more communicative.</p>

<p>"Captain Cressingham," he said with a deprecatory
shake of his head, "you must not ask me to betray my
Master's secrets."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>Paul accepted the rebuke with a good grace.</p>

<p>"You speak truth. I have no right to pry into his
affairs. I apologize."</p>

<p>Secrecy is always suspicious. Lambro's reticence
served but to whet Paul's curiosity. A weird interest
began to gather around the unknown owner of Castel
Nuovo, who was so studious of concealing his identity,
who without previous warning came and vanished at
irregular intervals on errands that necessitated a reserve
in speaking of them.</p>

<p>At this point Jacintha reappeared carrying a lighted
lamp.</p>

<p>"Would my lady like to retire now?"</p>

<p>Yes, my lady would, and arose for that purpose. Paul
held the door as she passed forth.</p>

<p>"Good night, signorina."</p>

<p>She returned the valediction, accompanying it with a
graceful inclination of her head, and a grateful smile that
said as plainly as words could say, "But for you I should
now be without bed."</p>

<p>The room to which Jacintha conducted Barbara was
intended as a lady's bedchamber, as the toilet accessories
sufficiently proved. A princess could not have found fault
with its dainty tasteful appointments. And, surprising to
relate, not a particle of dust was visible anywhere; the
place was clean, swept, and garnished as if prepared that
very day for the reception of a visitor.</p>

<p>"You are not giving up your own room to me, I hope?"
said Barbara.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my lady. I do not sleep here."</p>

<p>Barbara stared hard at the speaker. Seeing that the
"Master," according to Lambro's statement, was a foe
to womankind, it was singular, to say the least of it,
that Castel Nuovo should contain a chamber of this
description.</p>

<p>Tired as Barbara was, her curiosity would not let her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
rest, and she wandered about the room asking a variety
of questions. Had this been a bridal-chamber, or a
death-chamber, or both? Had the mysterious "Master,"
mourning the loss of a wife or a daughter, given
command that this apartment should be attended to every
day, preserved in the same order as that in which it was
when last occupied? Barbara could extract nothing from
the reticent Jacintha, who seemed troubled by her visitor's
catechism.</p>

<p>In her course round the apartment Barbara's quick
eyes detected a circular piece of violet-colored sealing-wax
adhering to one of the walls. She inquired how it
came there, but Jacintha professed ignorance. Attracted
by an indefinable feeling, Barbara asked that the lamp
might be brought near. The wax was situated at a point
just where a horizontal band of carving that formed the
upper border of a panel touched upon the smooth plain
oak above. A closer inspection showed that the wax bore
the image of a paschal lamb,&mdash;an image, tiny indeed, yet
perfectly clear. The wax had been stamped with a seal.
Why? Children might perhaps find pleasure in fixing a
piece of wax upon a wall and in stamping it with a seal,
but as there were no children at Castel Nuovo this explanation
would not suffice. If it were the work of adults
what was its purport? Jacintha averred that it was not
her doing; she could not say whose it was or assign any
reason for its origin.</p>

<p>"Can you not put me in another room?"</p>

<p>"The other rooms are somewhat damp. Why, my
lady, what do you fear?" she asked in reproachful
surprise.</p>

<p>A hard question. It was impossible to link this piece
of wax with any harm to herself, so Barbara turned
away. The dainty little bed invited her to repose. Why
trouble further?</p>

<p>When at last Barbara with a delicious sense of relief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
had slipped her tired and aching limbs beneath the sheets,
Jacintha brought to the bedside a glass containing a dark-colored
liquid.</p>

<p>"Only quinine, my lady."</p>

<p>In a moment Barbara was sitting up in manifest fear,
her eyes large and ghost-like.</p>

<p>"You don't think I have caught malaria?"</p>

<p>"It is best to take precautions," replied Jacintha,
evasively.</p>

<p>"Fever? I have been dreading that," exclaimed Barbara,
clasping her hands. "And I must be at Zara to-morrow.
If I linger here I shall be caught by&mdash;Give
me the quinine; give me double, treble the ordinary
draught, if it will act as an antidote."</p>

<p>Barbara, after taking the potion, fell asleep almost immediately,
and Jacintha returned to the dining-hall, where
in answer to her eager questioning Paul gave an account
of the meeting in the forest and related all he knew concerning
Barbara, which, in truth, was not very much.</p>

<p>"And now tell me, Jacintha," he said, when he had
finished, "why did you start so on first seeing the
signorina?"</p>

<p>Jacintha seemed absolutely terror-stricken at this question.
The old Palicar who had been drinking somewhat
freely of the maraschino turned upon his consort with a
fierce frown, drew his yataghan and shook it furiously at
her.</p>

<p>"If ever you let that matter out&mdash;you know what I
mean&mdash;by God, I'll cut your throat. Be off, woman!
Go to bed; and remember what I say."</p>

<p>And Jacintha, who evidently stood thoroughly in awe
of the fiery little Greek, withdrew without a word.</p>

<p>"Captain Cressingham," continued Lambro in a
quieter tone, "you may believe me or not, as you will,
but it is a fact that Jacintha and myself have never seen
the signorina till to-night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor her portrait?"</p>

<p>"Nor her portrait."</p>

<p>Something in his manner convinced Paul that the old
Palicar was speaking the truth, which only made the matter
more perplexing. Despite the repudiation there was
evidently some mystery connected with Barbara, a
mystery known to Lambro and his consort. Paul intuitively
felt that the Palicar's reticence could never be overcome,
but he was not without hope of extracting the
secret from Jacintha if he should have an opportunity of
speaking with her alone.</p>

<p>"Paul Cressingham," he murmured, when he found
himself left in the dining-hall for the night, "you came
to Dalmatia in quest of the strange, the romantic, the
wild. I am beginning to think you have found them."
He drew his chair to the fire, composed himself for
sleep, and dreamed of Barbara till morning gleamed
through the casement.</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER III<br /><br />
FEVER AND CONVALESCENCE</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>Of the four occupants of Castel Nuovo the first to
awaken in the morning was Jacintha, who, after
dressing, proceeded immediately to Barbara's
room. Having tapped at the door, first softly, then
loudly, and receiving no answer, she ventured to enter.</p>

<p>Barbara was awake, and talking to herself in a very
odd manner.</p>

<p>She took no notice of the approach of Jacintha, and
the latter perceived at once that her forebodings were
realized.</p>

<p>Barbara, her dark hair lying in disorder on her pillow,
a bright color burning in her cheek, the light of reason
quenched in her eye, was in a high state of fever. She was
not speaking in Italian, the language used by her the
previous evening, but in another tongue altogether strange
to Jacintha.</p>

<p>The latter returned quickly to her own room to make it
known to Lambro, who had just struggled into his finery.</p>

<p>"What else could be expected after sleeping at night in
a damp forest?" was his comment. "Fever! and she in
that very chamber, too! By God, if the Master should
return and find her there!"</p>

<p>"Come and listen to her. She is talking in a strange
language: she looks at me with piteous eyes as if making
some request. Perhaps you can understand her."</p>

<p>The old Palicar followed her to Barbara's chamber.
His roving life in the Balkan Peninsula had given him a
knowledge, more or less imperfect, of all the languages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
spoken from the Danube to Maina, but he failed to identify
the speech of Barbara with any one of these.</p>

<p>"It's not Romaic, nor Turkish, nor Albanian, nor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Jacintha, in a startled voice.</p>

<p>Amid the plaintive flow of unintelligible sound there
came at irregular intervals a recurrence of the same three
syllables.</p>

<p>"<i>Rav-en-na!</i>" murmured Jacintha with white lips.</p>

<p>"She's thinking of Ravenna on the other side of the
sea," said Lambro, indicating the direction with his hand.
"Wishes to go there perhaps."</p>

<p>"No, no. Have you forgotten? Ravenna! That's
what the last one said when she raved. 'O Ravenna, what
have you done?' were her words."</p>

<p>Lambro stared dubiously at Jacintha. Then the eyes of
both turned simultaneously to the violet sealing-wax on
the wall, as if that had some connection with the name.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," muttered the old Palicar, turning
away uneasily. "There's something eerie about it. How
has the signorina got hold of that name?"</p>

<p>Leaving Jacintha there he proceeded with subdued
mien to the dining-hall, and aroused Paul from slumber
with the question,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you ever had the malaria?"</p>

<p>"Can any one live in your cursed Greek climate, and
not take it?" said Paul, somewhat resenting the rough
shaking he had received.</p>

<p>"Then you run no risk of taking it again by staying
here."</p>

<p>Paul was wide awake now, and sprang instantly to his
feet.</p>

<p>"You mean that the signorina has caught the fever?"</p>

<p>"That is so. She'll not see Zara for some weeks&mdash;if
indeed at all. You have done a nice thing for me, Captain
Cressingham, for she cannot be removed now. And
what will the Master say if he should return and find a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
fever-stricken person in his house? His was wise advice,
after all. 'Admit no strangers in my absence, Lambro.'
I have broken his orders, and this is the result."</p>

<p>It may have been selfish on the part of Paul, but his
thoughts were too much set on Barbara to permit of commiseration
for Lambro's position. Never had he been
attracted by any maiden as he had been by Barbara, and
now to learn that she was in a dangerous fever filled him
with a feeling akin to horror.</p>

<p>"Where does the nearest doctor live? I must fetch
him at once."</p>

<p>"She's a dead woman if you do. Leave her to Jacintha,
and she may recover; trust her to a Dalmatian
doctor, and she'll certainly die."</p>

<p>With which assurance Lambro retired grumbling terribly,
for inasmuch as all Jacintha's attention would be
required by the patient, he foresaw that for the next
month he would have to prepare his own meals, and likewise
those of Paul, should the latter choose to remain at
Castel Nuovo; and if there was aught that the old Palicar
disliked it was work, even of the lightest sort.</p>

<p>In descending the stairs Paul was met by Jacintha.</p>

<p>"There is no use in disguising the truth," she said in
answer to his eager questioning. "The signorina is in a
very dangerous state. But leave her to me, and she shall
recover. I was a nurse at Constantinople, remember;
and in the matter of fever I know what to do as well as
a doctor, perhaps better than any you will find in this
uncivilized region."</p>

<p>Impressed somehow by Jacintha's faith in her own
powers Paul felt that Barbara could not be in better
hands.</p>

<p>"And you will remain at Castel Nuovo till she recovers?"</p>

<p>Paul gladly assented to this proposal.</p>

<p>"I know that she is a stranger to you," continued Jacintha,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
"but still she came here under your guidance and
protection, and therefore in some measure you are responsible
for her safety. Yes, I say, safety. Captain
Cressingham," she added, with a strange earnestness,
"your presence here is necessary. The signorina is in
peril. If the Master should return and find&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off abruptly, perceiving Lambro at the foot
of the staircase.</p>

<p>"Now, Jacintha, attend to your patient. I'll see to the
captain's breakfast."</p>

<p>And awed by the cold glittering eye of her partner,
Jacintha became mute and glided away.</p>

<p>That day, and the few days that followed, formed the
most unhappy time that Paul had ever known, for the
fair maiden whom he loved lay in the mystic borderland
betwixt life and death.</p>

<p>He haunted the corridor leading to her bedroom, either
sitting silent in the recess of an embrasured window, or
walking to and fro with noiseless tread, eagerly questioning
Jacintha whenever she appeared. She began to pity
this young Englishman with his haggard looks, so much
so that she always returned favorable answers, even when
the waters of the dark river had almost closed over the
head of her patient.</p>

<p>Mindful of Barbara's escape from a convent, Paul
would not wander more than a few yards from the castle,
fearful lest the ecclesiastical authorities or the Austrian
gendarmes should make their appearance during his absence,
to say nothing of the return of the mysterious
Master, whose presence was equally to be guarded against,
if Jacintha had spoken truly.</p>

<p>Paul's refusal to accompany Lambro for a sail on the
sea or on a tramp through the woods with his dogs provoked
that worthy's contempt. A fine soldierly fellow
like Paul to be fretting over a thing of a girl, when a
Circassian equally lovely could be bought in the neighboring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
province of Albania for five hundred beshliks, with
the additional advantage of selling the damsel again when
she had ceased to please. It was absurd!</p>

<p>At last one day Jacintha was able to announce that
Barbara had passed the crisis. The relief to Paul's overwrought
mind was so great that he almost felt as if he
himself, and not Barbara, had been the sufferer.</p>

<p>"And you will be glad to learn, Captain Cressingham,"
said the nurse, with a smile that had a hidden meaning in
it, "that the illness has left no disfiguring traces on her
beauty."</p>

<p>She was still too weak for conversation, and Jacintha
averred that some days must elapse before she could let
him see the patient.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Paul did not fail to remind
her daily of his existence.</p>

<p>Near by lived a charcoal-burner accustomed to call at
the castle for the purpose of bringing Jacintha her stock
of provisions from the market-town.</p>

<p>Making use of this man Paul every day procured the
loveliest of flowers, in addition to fruits and other delicacies,
and these, accompanied by wishes for her welfare, he
would send up to the patient through the medium of the
faithful Jacintha, who in turn brought back Barbara's
expressions of gratitude.</p>

<p>The period of Barbara's convalescence was a somewhat
dull time for Paul, self-debarred as he was from quitting
the vicinity of the castle.</p>

<p>He tried to take an interest in Lambro's companionship,
despite his indefinable suspicion of the old Palicar, but he
soon grew tired of hearing the same stories, for there was
but one theme upon which the Greek would converse,
namely, the Hellenic War of Independence,&mdash;a war in
which, though history be strangely silent on the matter,
Lambro had taken the leading part, at least, according to
his own account.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>Occasionally the vain old man, forgetful that his
strength and skill were departing, would invite Paul to a
fencing-bout; if defeated, he grew angry; but when
Paul, in the exercise of a little <i>finesse</i>, permitted himself
to be worsted, then Lambro, suspecting the trick played
upon him, grew more angry still; so that there was no
pleasing him. In short, he was a somewhat trying individual
to live with, and Paul was never sorry when he
saw him setting off for a long tramp by the shore or
through the woods, attended by his twelve mastiffs, brutes
big and ferocious, but esteemed by Paul because they were
such, since they would prove excellent auxiliaries against
any foe who should approach the castle with intent to
carry off Barbara, and that such abduction might be attempted
was a fear ever present to his mind.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was quite within the range of probability that
any day a serious fray might occur, for heedless as to what
the Austrian law might be in the matter of maidens who
escaped from convents, Paul was determined that Barbara
should not be surrendered to the authorities without opposition
on his part; while Lambro, though disposed to look
upon the fair fugitive somewhat in the light of an encumbrance,
was nevertheless fierce in declaring, with a
fine scorn of consequences, that he would shoot the first
gendarme who should attempt to cross <i>his</i> threshold; and
Paul had little doubt that the fiery old Klepht would keep
his word.</p>

<p>Still, this was not quite the sort of recreation that Paul
wanted.</p>

<p>"Have you no books here?" he asked of Lambro one
day.</p>

<p>"Would you turn caloyer or papa? No? Then, what
can you want with books?"</p>

<p>"Your classic ancestors would not have asked that
question. To read, of course."</p>

<p>"Bah! the best use you can put books to is to twist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
them into cartridges. That's what we did with them in
the war." In Lambro's opinion there had only been one
war worthy of the name. "Did you ever hear of the siege
of &mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"But as to the books now?" gently murmured Paul,
who did not wish to hear anything about the siege of &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Books? Yes, there are some here in the topmost
room of the castle; but you cannot get at them, for that
room is the Master's study; and on his departure he
always locks the door, and takes the key with him."</p>

<p>Paul, with his head full of suspicion against the Master,
could discern nothing but a sinister caution in his practice
of keeping the study-door locked during his absence. Accordingly
on the following day when Lambro was out of
the way, and Jacintha occupied with her patient, Paul
ascended the staircase leading to the upper portion of the
tower. On the topmost landing of all he came upon a
stout door of oak securely locked. This without doubt
was the entrance of the study spoken of by Lambro. A
pendant on the other side of the key-hole prevented Paul
from obtaining the slightest glimpse of the interior.</p>

<p>Not only had the Master left this door locked, but he
had likewise taken precautions to prevent any one during
his absence from entering without his knowledge, for the
hinges of the door were sealed with violet-colored wax
bearing the impress of a paschal lamb.</p>

<p>The care thus taken to screen the room from espionage
increased Paul's suspicions. Then he turned away, becoming
suddenly conscious that to pry thus upon the
affairs of a stranger was conduct unworthy of a soldier
and a gentleman; and yet a secret voice seemed to whisper
that he was justified in his proceeding, when he recalled
Jacintha's strange remark that the return of the
Master threatened Barbara's safety.</p>

<p>"Jacintha," said he, when next he saw that person,
"what secret is contained in that locked room at the top
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
of the tower, for," he added, proceeding beyond his
knowledge, "I am convinced that there is some mystery
connected with it."</p>

<p>That he was correct in his surmise was sufficiently
evinced by the look of fear that came over Jacintha's face.</p>

<p>"You must ask Lambro."</p>

<p>"He will not tell me."</p>

<p>"And I dare not."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Lambro would kill me if I should reveal the secret.
You yourself heard his threat. I have taken a solemn
oath upon the Holy Sacrament itself to preserve silence.
Do not speak of this matter again, I pray you," she continued,
with pain in her voice, "for, indeed, Captain
Cressingham, it is no concern of yours."</p>

<p>And then, as if desirous of reverting to a more pleasing
topic, she added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have good news for you. The signorina is now
strong enough to rise and be dressed. To-morrow you
shall see her."</p>

<p>This intelligence was more acceptable to Paul than the
baton of a general. He had very little sleep that night
for thinking of Barbara.</p>

<p>Next day at noon, Barbara having been dressed by
Jacintha, was assisted by the same faithful attendant to an
adjoining sitting-room, and comfortably installed in a big
arm-chair placed beside an open casement which commanded
a view of the sea.</p>

<p>How quick was the turn of her head towards the door
when Paul's step sounded there! How bright her smile
as she offered him her slender hand. How sweet the
color that played over her cheek while she thanked him
for the presents that he had sent up to her! A white rose
graced her dusky hair, the flower being, as Paul noticed
with secret pleasure, his gift of the previous day.</p>

<p>Jacintha had withdrawn on Paul's entrance. Wise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
creature, Jacintha! It is not every woman who will recognize
herself as <i>de trop</i> when youth and maiden meet.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you recovering, signorina."</p>

<p>"I am still very weak. I tremble to think what would
have become of me had I lain down in that wood. The
fever would certainly have carried me off. I owe my life
to you."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;to Jacintha."</p>

<p>"And to Jacintha, who will not take any reward from
me."</p>

<p>After this there was a silence. Paul found his usual
flow of language gone. He longed to be brilliant; he
was conscious of seeming stupid.</p>

<p>"It is six weeks since our meeting in the woods," he
observed, for want of a better remark.</p>

<p>"And you were going to Sebenico, then. Have you
remained at Castel Nuovo all this time on my account?"</p>

<p>"I desire to keep my promise of seeing you safely to
Zara."</p>

<p>Barbara murmured her gratitude, adding,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But am I not putting you to great inconvenience?"</p>

<p>"No, signorina, no. These are my holidays. I am on
a long furlough. My time is my own, or rather it is at
your disposal."</p>

<p>Barbara's eyes drooped beneath Paul's gaze. Why
should this handsome young captain interest himself so
on her behalf?</p>

<p>"Jacintha tells me that you have never quitted the
vicinity of the castle."</p>

<p>"True. It has been my desire to guard against a surprise
on the part of your pursuers."</p>

<p>Barbara's face lost its bright expression for a moment.</p>

<p>"My pursuers!" she murmured. "My pursuers! The
thought of them haunted me while I lay ill. I dreaded
lest I should be carried off in my helpless state. But as
six weeks have elapsed I think I may regard the pursuit&mdash;if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
pursuit there were&mdash;as over. But tell me, Captain
Cressingham,"&mdash;how prettily the name fell from her
lips!&mdash;"what would you have done if my pursuers had
appeared?"</p>

<p>"Fought," replied Paul laconically.</p>

<p>"But supposing they had been a dozen in number?"</p>

<p>"No matter. Lambro loves a fight, so do I. Castel
Nuovo was built to stand a siege. The door is of massive
oak; the lower windows are barred; there are abundant
loopholes convenient for taking shots at the enemy. And
besides there are the twelve mastiffs, each of which is
capable of tackling a man. Trust us, signorina, we should
have made a good defence."</p>

<p>It was pleasant to be near such towers of strength as
Paul and Lambro, who appeared to regard Austrian
gendarmerie with contempt. Then her pleasure became
lost in surprise. Was this Englishman really willing to
undergo such perils on her behalf? Ay, those, and much
more, Barbara, to gain your smiles.</p>

<p>"I am fortunate in my friends," she said, "but rather
than expose them to such hazard I think I should prefer
to give myself up."</p>

<p>She was a sweet and interesting patient, and the charm
of her face and figure was enhanced by the toilette in
which Jacintha had arrayed her,&mdash;a dress all soft and
white and foamy with silk muslin. A silver rope girdle
was tied at one side and fell in two long, graceful tassels.
Delicate antique lace fringed the slender wrists. Paul's
quick eye observed that a small portion of the lace was
torn off from the right sleeve. He wondered why the
defect had not been repaired. A trifling circumstance,
but one destined to recur with peculiar force at a later
date.</p>

<p>This was not the costume she had worn on the night of
her first meeting with him. Whence, then, did it come?
Barbara seemed to divine his thoughts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>"I see you are observing my dress," she remarked. "It
is a gift from Jacintha, drawn from an old chest in her
wardrobe. It might have been expressly made for me, for
it fits to a nicety without requiring the least alteration.
Made for another, and yet suiting me to perfection. Is
not that a singular coincidence?"</p>

<p>The fit of the dress did not strike Paul so much as the
costliness of the material. He could not account for
Jacintha's possession of such attire except on the supposition
that it formed part of the flotsam and jetsam which
supplied Lambro with his finery.</p>

<p>Again Barbara seemed to read his thoughts.</p>

<p>"No, it is not a gift of the sea; Jacintha assured me of
that; otherwise I would not wear it. I have no liking for
the clothing of the drowned." And then displaying a
pair of pretty satin shoes, she added: "And these, too,
are Jacintha's gift, and they fit as if my feet had been
measured for them."</p>

<p>She turned to the open casement and surveyed the scene
without.</p>

<p>"Ah! if I could but get into the air outside I should
recover the sooner."</p>

<p>"Then come down to-morrow, and sit outside on the
terrace."</p>

<p>"I am too weak to walk."</p>

<p>"No matter. I will carry you," replied Paul, boldly.</p>

<p>"I shall have to get Jacintha's leave first," said Barbara,
half-pleased, half-reluctant. "Jacintha is an ideal nurse.
She will have her commands obeyed, and will not yield
to the whims of her patient."</p>

<p>When Jacintha appeared, her consent was readily obtained,
and as she averred that Barbara had talked enough
for one day, Paul was compelled to take his leave.</p>

<p>He spent the rest of the day in recalling Barbara's
words. The interview, though delightful, contained one
element of disappointment: Barbara had said nothing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
to her previous history. Paul had hesitated to question
her on the matter, leaving her to take the initiative. Time
would doubtless bring increasing confidence on her part.</p>

<p>On the following day he redeemed his promise of carrying
her into the open air. An exquisite sense of pleasure
filled him as he felt the clasp of Barbara's arm around his
neck and noted the sweet color that mantled her cheek.
From her chamber he bore her down the staircase and out
to a dismantled marble terrace, where he seated her in a
lounge, which had been placed there by Jacintha. Above
her rose a stately terebinth, whose light-green foliage,
crimsoned with clusters of delicate flowers, cast a circle
of shade around.</p>

<p>It was the height of summer, and the day, though hot,
was not oppressive; the atmosphere being tempered by
the air flowing from the Dalmatian highlands that rose
behind them, peak above peak, in dark wooded glory.</p>

<p>Facing them was the smooth Adriatic almost as blue as
the heaven it reflected. Far off in the summer haze
picturesque feluccas, with their white lateen sails, glided
to and fro with slow dream-like motion.</p>

<p>Sea, sky, and mountains combined to form a scene of
enchanting beauty, rendered still more enchanting to Paul
by the presence of Barbara, to whom Jacintha had imparted
an additional charm by adorning her with the
graceful <i>pezzotto</i>, or muslin scarf, which, pinned on the
head and falling over the arms and shoulders, permitted
the beautiful face and hair of the wearer to be seen
through it.</p>

<p>"Have you ever noticed, Captain Cressingham, how
trifles annoy when one is in a state of illness? And I am
annoyed by a trifle, one so absurd that I feel ashamed to
mention it."</p>

<p>Paul urged her, nevertheless, to describe the annoyance.</p>

<p>"What torments me is a piece of sealing-wax on a panel
in my bedroom. Reposing the other night, with my eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
turned towards it, I was seized by a singular fancy. The
wax seemed to be receding through the wall, drawing me
after it. Reason told me that this could not be so, that the
wax was immovably fixed to the panel, and that I was in
bed; yet all the same, there was the circle of wax gliding
onward with never-ending motion through the realm of
air, and myself floating along in its wake like a disembodied
spirit. This sensation occurs every night.
My mind is kept perpetually on the rack following that
piece of wax through the infinity of space, ever lured onward
by the hope of arriving at some goal. But that goal
perpetually evades me, and therein is the torment."</p>

<p>"Having had the malaria myself," observed Paul, "I
can testify that such queer notions do occur. What is the
color of this wax?" he added, having little doubt as to
what the answer would be.</p>

<p>"It is of a violet hue, and bears the impress of a lamb
carrying a banner. I cannot go back to that chamber
again," continued Barbara, "or I shall be driven mad,
for the annoyance is depriving me of all sleep. I must
change my room, even though my good nurse is opposed
to it."</p>

<p>But Jacintha did not offer any opposition when Paul
made known her patient's desire for a different sleeping-room;
without any demur she immediately set about
preparing another chamber.</p>

<p>That same night, when all was still in the castle, Paul,
taking a revolver and a lamp, sought the room vacated by
Barbara. He quickly discovered the piece of stamped
wax, and saw that it corresponded precisely with the seal
upon the door of the mysterious study.</p>

<p>Extinguishing his lamp, he sat down on a chair beside
the panel, determined to watch there during the night to
ascertain, if possible, whether there was any ground for
Barbara's strange fancy.</p>

<p>It was a long and dreary vigil, and when the gray light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
of dawn stole in through the casement, and nothing had
occurred to excite suspicion, he was fain to question the
wisdom of his action.</p>

<p>That day Paul again carried Barbara downstairs to
breathe the pure air of the sunlit terrace.</p>

<p>"My sleep last night was sweet and sound," she remarked.
"With my new bedroom, and with this glorious
air, I shall soon be well again."</p>

<p>She looked so radiant that Paul refrained from mentioning
his nocturnal vigil. Though full of indefinable
suspicion himself, he had no wish to alarm her mind; and
he had laid both on Lambro and Jacintha an injunction to
maintain silence respecting the locked room.</p>

<p>Barbara's strength gradually returned. In a day or
two she was able to stand, and, leaning upon Paul's arm,
she walked to and fro in the immediate vicinity of the
castle. These promenades were soon lengthened into
rambles along the seashore or through the fragrant pine
woods, Paul being her constant companion. She had
taken his arm at first from weakness; she now continued
to do so from habit.</p>

<p>As his knowledge of Barbara increased Paul discovered
that she had received an extraordinary education,
her course of study having been as remarkable for what it
omitted as for what it contained. While knowing very
little of poetry, painting, music, needle-work, and other
accomplishments usually included in the feminine curriculum,
she was nevertheless well versed in mathematics,
logic, and "the dismal science," to wit, political economy.
Classic antiquity was almost a sealed book to her, but
modern history and current continental politics she had at
her finger-tips, and her knowledge of royal and noble
genealogies with all their ramifications might have put a
herald to the blush. She could give the biographies, and
the characteristic foibles, of all the leading statesmen of
Europe; was mistress of several modern languages, notably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Polish or Russian, and&mdash;most puzzling circumstance
of all&mdash;she was quite <i>au fait</i> with the mysteries
and subtleties of Catholic theology.</p>

<p>As she could scarcely have passed her twentieth year, it
seemed to Paul that Barbara, in view of her extensive
acquirements, must have commenced her studies so soon
as she had quitted her cradle.</p>

<p>Her intellectual training appeared more adapted to the
acquirements of a ruler, a statesman, or an ambassador
than to those of an ordinary young lady; and Paul
puzzled himself to account for the aims of those who had
directed her education, for Barbara herself volunteered
no information on the matter, and still maintained an
attitude of reticence as to her past life.
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
THE SEALED CHAMBER</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>When, amid the most enchanting scenery to be
found in Europe, and at a time when all the
charms of summer are poured upon the earth,
a handsome young captain is brought into companionship
with a youthful woman, whose intellect charms even more
than her beauty; and when the pair dwell isolated from
the rest of the world with nothing to divert attention from
each other, it requires no prophet to predict the result.</p>

<p>Barbara was now out of her convalescent stage; and,
therefore, neither she nor Paul had any valid excuse for
remaining longer at Castel Nuovo; nevertheless they continued
to postpone indefinitely the day of departure.</p>

<p>Paul completely ignored the regiment at Corfu, and the
good uncle, who was doubtless fuming at his nephew's
protracted absence; and Barbara on her part seemed to
have forgotten her pursuers from the convent, and her
desire for the protection of the British flag.</p>

<p>Enwrapped in each other, yielding to the delicious spirit
of <i>dolce far niente</i>, the pair were leading an idyllian life.</p>

<p>To Lambro and Jacintha the scenery around was as it
had always been, but to Paul and Barbara, mountains, sea,
air, sky, had become steeped in hues of divine beauty;
each succeeding day seemed happier than the preceding.</p>

<p>They entertained a dreamy notion that their life at
Castel Nuovo would not last forever, but its end they put
far from their thoughts. The golden present was all in
all. Why anticipate pain? <i>Vogue la galère.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>Lambro offered no opposition to their stay, though the
thought of the Master's return gave him some uneasiness
at times, and he said as much to Jacintha.</p>

<p>"I wish he would come," was her reply. "I should
like to see his face when he sets eyes upon the signorina."</p>

<p>"He'll think as we did, that she has risen from the
dead," returned Lambro.</p>

<p>"Well, she has a protector in Captain Cressingham,
who will know how to deal with the Master, should he
appear."</p>

<p>"Humph! there'll be the devil to pay ere long,"
growled Lambro. That Jacintha was not married to the
old Greek troubled Barbara very little, if at all. Jacintha
had brought her back to life; Jacintha was as good as
gold; Barbara, figuratively speaking, would have turned
and rent any one who should have ventured to assail the
reputation of Jacintha.</p>

<p>For, thanks to new influences, Barbara's character was
undergoing development. The stateliness and gravity
that had marked her bearing on the first night of her
coming to Castel Nuovo were yielding to a more buoyant
and girlish spirit.</p>

<p>Close to the castle a semicircle of dark rocks, with a
sandy base, over which the tide flowed, formed an ideal
bathing place. Every morning Barbara would seek this
spot attended by Jacintha.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't Abbess Teresa and the nuns be scandalized
if they saw me now?" she would remark as she returned
to breakfast, laughing and wringing out her dark wet
locks like some lovely Nereid.</p>

<p>She was a maiden formed for gayety. In previous
days her natural disposition had evidently been kept under
restraint. She was now revelling in the sunshine of a new
and sweet liberty, and Jacintha could scarcely believe her
own eyes, when one day, attracted by the sounds of sweet
laughter and of ringing steel proceeding from an adjoining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
apartment, she peeped in and discovered the cause of
it all to be Barbara, who was receiving her first lesson in
fencing from Paul, while Lambro looked on with sombre
approval.</p>

<p>"What next, I wonder?" thought Jacintha.</p>

<p>Barbara illumined the dark and melancholy castle like
a sunbeam. Even Lambro relaxed something of his
moroseness in her presence, and had begun to doubt
whether five hundred beshliks could procure in the mart
of Janina a maiden in all respects like Barbara. She had
taken to Lambro much more than Paul had, who could
not overcome his secret distrust of the old Palicar.</p>

<p>But then Lambro was a hero in Barbara's eyes, because
he had fought for the freedom of a conquered race, and
she herself, as it subsequently transpired, was the daughter
of a conquered race.</p>

<p>When the day's strolling with Paul was over, and the
evening meal finished, she would invite the old Greek to
fight his battles over again. Sitting on a low stool at his
feet, and resting her elbows on her lap and her chin on
her hands, her hair sometimes falling in dusky waves
around her fair throat, she would betray such interest in
Lambro's reminiscences that the foolish Paul was often
moved to jealousy.</p>

<p>"And by deeds such as these," she murmured on one
occasion, "was the freedom of Hellas won. Why should
not Poland achieve what Greece has achieved?"</p>

<p>"So, signorina, you are of Polish blood?" smiled Paul.</p>

<p>"And am proud of my nationality."</p>

<p>"I would for your sake that your people were free."</p>

<p>"They <i>will</i> be free again," she answered, a beautiful
heroic look transfiguring her face with a new light. "Oh!
Kosciusko," she cried, with an outburst of patriotism that
quite surprised Paul, "why did you say '<i>Finis Poloniæ</i>'?
Because <i>you</i> said it, men have come to believe it. No,
no, it is not true. The greenstone sceptre of Poland may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
lie in the treasury of the Kremlin broken in halves, but
the spirit of the Polish people is not broken. Would that
I had been born a man that I might shoulder musket and
fight for fatherland! The Princess Radzivil fought on
horseback against the Russians, and why may not I?"
And then raising her wine-glass aloft, she added, "Confusion
to the Czar!"</p>

<p>"Amen," said Lambro, responsive to the toast. "We
had to assassinate old Capo d'Istria because he was too
much under Russian influence. Ah! how we danced the
Romaïka the night he died!"</p>

<p>This remark of Lambro created a diversion, for Barbara,
who had never seen the Greek national dance, asked
him to describe it.</p>

<p>The old Palicar did more than describe,&mdash;he acted it.
Kicking his embroidered slippers into the air he went
through all the flings and evolutions of the Romaïka with
an agility surprising for one so aged, at the same time
chanting an appropriate ballad.</p>

<p>"Ah! who could leap higher than Lambro in his
youth?" he cried, when he had finished his performance.</p>

<p>Barbara thanked him, and observed, with a pretty air
of command, that as Lambro had done something to entertain
them it was now Paul's turn to do the like.</p>

<p>And Paul began by singing the first song that entered
his head and that happened to be "The Mistletoe Bough,"
at that time not so hackneyed a ballad as now, and probably
never before heard in the hall of a Dalmatian castle.
At any rate it was new to his hearers, and Barbara in
particular seemed much interested by it.</p>

<p>"Is there any truth in it?" she asked at its conclusion.</p>

<p>"Supposed to be founded on fact," returned Paul, proceeding
to relate the story of the fair lady of Modena.</p>

<p>"Ginevra, if she had lived at Castel Nuovo," observed
Barbara, "might have found a better place of concealment
than an oaken chest. Now," she added, prompted by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
playful impulse, "give me a clear start of one minute, and
without going outside the castle I will undertake to hide
where no one shall find me."</p>

<p>She sprang up, and with laughing eyes and graceful
step danced from the apartment.</p>

<p>"She is still a girl, you see," smiled Paul.</p>

<p>Entering into the fun of the thing they allowed a full
minute to elapse, and then set off to find her.</p>

<p>They went through the castle from roof to basement,
exploring every place capable of affording concealment.
But Barbara was invisible; she had vanished as if completely
melted to air.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour had passed in this search. Then they
went again through the building loudly calling her by
name, and, proclaiming themselves beaten, they invited
her to come forth from her hiding place.</p>

<p>Their appeal met with no response. They stared dubiously
at one another. The affair had begun to lose its
humorous side. The death-like silence, Barbara's invisibility,
the gray twilight now stealing through the castle,
caused it to assume a somewhat ghostly aspect.</p>

<p>"She must have gone outside," said Lambro.</p>

<p>"She promised to keep within the building," observed
Paul.</p>

<p>For the third time they explored the castle, ending their
search on the highest landing of the staircase. Here
they paused before the locked door of the mysterious
study.</p>

<p>"She is perhaps concealed here," suggested Paul.</p>

<p>"Impossible," returned Lambro, pointing to the wax.
"The Master's seal is unbroken."</p>

<p>"There is an entrance to this room leading from the
chamber in which the signorina first slept," remarked
Paul quietly.</p>

<p>This statement was pure conjecture on his part, but its
truth was instantly made evident by Lambro's manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
He turned so savagely upon Jacintha that Paul thought
he was going to strike her.</p>

<p>"So you couldn't keep your tongue quiet?"</p>

<p>"You err," said Paul, hastening to vindicate the
woman. "Jacintha has told me nothing. It is simply a
guess of mine, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly and placed his ear to the door.</p>

<p>"By heaven, there is some one in this room. I can
detect a sound within. Signorina, are you here?" he
cried, rapping upon the panels.</p>

<p>The dusk of the landing was suddenly illumined by a
light that came and went in a moment. Merely a flash of
summer lightning.</p>

<p>It was accompanied by something startling within. A
faint cry of "Oh!"&mdash;plainly the voice of Barbara; a
dull thud as of the fall of a human body, and then a significant
stillness.</p>

<p>With a soldier's promptitude Paul flung himself against
the door, bruising his shoulders by the violence of the
impact.</p>

<p>"You'll never force that door," said Lambro. "It's
too strong. We must go downstairs. The signorina must
have got in here through the secret panel in the bedroom."</p>

<p>Paul darted down the staircase, and in a moment more
was within the bedchamber. He saw what had escaped
his eye in the three previous explorations, namely, that
the circular piece of violet-colored wax was traversed by
a horizontal fracture, clearly caused by the moving of the
panel. Lambro, who had followed close upon Paul,
touched a certain spring hidden within some ornamental
carving of the wall, and the panel glided off laterally,
revealing a narrow corridor behind.</p>

<p>"To the left," said Lambro. "There's a staircase a
few feet off. At the top of that another to the right.
Mount that and you'll see the Master's room before
you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>It was strange that the old Palicar did not follow Paul
up the staircase, but so it was. He remained in the bedroom
by the open panel with his hand to his ear in the
attitude of listening.</p>

<p>"Oh, if she has discovered&mdash;it!" said Jacintha, with
clasped hands.</p>

<p>"Well, what if she has? It was not our doing, nor
the Master's for the matter of that."</p>

<p>"When I heard the signorina fall just now it brought
the heart to my mouth. It reminded me of that other
fall&mdash;you know whose. And in the same room, too!
If&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue! How can I listen while you keep
chattering?"</p>

<p>Paul, following the directions given by Lambro, had
ascended the two staircases, and passing through a square
opening in a panelled wall similar to that which he had
just quitted, found himself in the mysterious study.</p>

<p>Barbara lay upon the floor in a seeming swoon.</p>

<p>Paul cast one swift glance around the apartment, but
failed to discern anything in its present state calculated to
inspire fear.</p>

<p>Kneeling by Barbara's side he raised her to a sitting
posture, and passing his left arm around her rested her
head upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Dearest Barbara, what has frightened you?" he
asked, observing that her eyes were opening. It was the
first time he had addressed her by her Christian name;
the word had escaped him quite involuntarily. "What
has frightened you?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"That!" she said.</p>

<p>Like a timid child she clung to him, and indicating as
the cause of her fear the life-size portrait of a man hanging
upon the wall,&mdash;a portrait scarcely discernible in the
dim light.</p>

<p>"Take me away," she murmured faintly. "There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
something strange in the atmosphere of this room, something
that I can't understand, something that makes me
fear. Take me away."</p>

<p>As she seemed unable of herself to rise, Paul raised her
light form in his arms and carried her down the secret
stairway, through the bedchamber, past the wondering
Lambro and his consort, back again into the dining-hall
whence she had first set out.</p>

<p>She neither blushed nor resisted at finding herself in
his arms, apparently not giving the matter a thought.
Her fear overpowered every other emotion.</p>

<p>"Lambro," she asked, when somewhat revived by a
stimulant administered by Jacintha. "There is a man's
portrait on the wall of that room. Whose?"</p>

<p>"The Master's."</p>

<p>"The Master's?" she echoed in a tone of dismay.
"Have I been living all this time in the house of my
enemy?"</p>

<p>"You know the Master, then?" inquired Paul of
Barbara. "What is his name?"</p>

<p>"Cardinal Ravenna."</p>

<p>"The Master <i>is</i> a cardinal, I believe," said Lambro.
"Ravenna? Humph! I have heard him called that by&mdash;by
some; but it's not the name he usually bears when
here."</p>

<p>"You serve a very bad master, Lambro," said Barbara
reproachfully.</p>

<p>The old Palicar shrugged his shoulders in lieu of a
reply.</p>

<p>Paul here recalled Lambro's remark to the effect that
the Master belonged to a peculiar brotherhood pledged to
the repudiation of women. This misogyny was now explained.
But why should the abode of a Roman ecclesiastic
contain a lady's bedchamber kept in a state of preparation
for an occupant? Paul glanced at Jacintha as if
seeking an explanation from her, but the old Greek had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
set a warning eye upon his partner, and under that glittering
terror Jacintha became mute.</p>

<p>"You have broken the Master's seal," grumbled Lambro,
turning to Barbara. "He will learn that some one
has been in that room. What excuse am I to make to
him?"</p>

<p>"How did you discover the secret panel?" asked Paul
of Barbara, and paying but scant respect to the Palicar's
complaint.</p>

<p>"By accident," she replied. "Sleeping or waking that
violet wax has exercised a fascination over me. Yesterday,
attracted by an indefinable impulse, I stole into the
bedchamber. Conjecturing that the panel might be a
movable one, I began to search for the spring. Fortune
favored my endeavors; I discovered the hidden corridor,
but did not venture within. To-day when I heard you
relate the story of Ginevra, I thought it would be a piece
of fun to hide behind the panel and get you to search for
me. While standing there in concealment the impulse
came upon me to go forward and explore. I ascended the
two staircases, and entered the upper room by a panel
which I found open. Till that moment curiosity had been
my only feeling, but as soon as I entered the gray twilight
of that room I found myself trembling; the place
seemed like a haunted chamber. And yet frightened
though I was I could not retreat. Some strange power
drew me on to the centre of the apartment, and there I
stood looking around for&mdash;I know not what. I could
hear your far-off cries, but I hesitated to answer lest the
sound of my voice should call forth something terrible
from this silent chamber.</p>

<p>"Then suddenly the sight of a lady's portrait hanging
on the wall impelled me forward and almost made me
forget my fears. The portrait was so like me that at first
I thought it must be mine, but I know it cannot be."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Paul.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I have never sat to an artist, and, moreover,
the lady is wearing a dress such as I have never worn.
She carries a sceptre in her hand and on her head is a
diadem. Who ever saw me with sceptre and diadem?
No; the portrait is not mine. Whose can it be? Do you
know, Lambro?"</p>

<p>The old Palicar shook his head, but Paul felt that little
reliance could be placed on his denial.</p>

<p>"In a distant corner," continued Barbara, "was another
portrait, less easy to examine since it hung in the
shadows. As I was moving forward a sudden gleam
illumined the dusky chamber, bringing every line of the
portrait into clear relief. I recognized the face of my
enemy, Cardinal Ravenna; he seemed to be smiling at
me with wicked satisfaction. Such fear and trembling
took hold of me that I fainted."</p>

<p>"And that is all you have seen?" said Lambro, with
evident relief, a feeling in which Jacintha seemed to
share.</p>

<p>"What else was there to see, then?" asked Paul, fixing
a significant look on the Palicar, who remained mute to
the question.</p>

<p>"And this place, you say, belongs to Cardinal Ravenna?"
said Barbara. "I must leave to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh! my lady, so soon?" cried Jacintha sorrowfully,
for she had become very fond of Barbara.</p>

<p>"If the cardinal should appear he will take me back to
the convent."</p>

<p>"By whose authority?" asked Paul, hotly.</p>

<p>"He is my guardian."</p>

<p>"That may be, but he shall not restore you to the
convent against your will. You have not taken the
vows of a nun?"</p>

<p>"No. I was placed in the convent to be educated
merely."</p>

<p>"And you do not wish to return?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>"After enjoying freedom? Oh! no, no."</p>

<p>"Then you shall not return," said Paul, decisively.</p>

<p>"Still I must leave here. I cannot stay longer under
this roof."</p>

<p>"True, but do not act hastily. Where are you going?
What are your plans? Take a day for reflection. That
brief delay will not make much difference. It is not likely
that the cardinal will appear to-morrow, and if he should,
what matters? For my own part I should very much like
to come face to face with the man who proposes to immure
you within the walls of a nunnery. He would not
find me honey-tongued, though such a course may seem
ungrateful after having so long enjoyed the shelter of
his roof. Fear him not, signorina. Remain at least
another day. Remember that to-morrow was fixed for
our sail to Isola Sacra."</p>

<p>Barbara was persuaded by these words. One day, as
Paul had said, would not make much difference.</p>

<p>"And I fainted at sight of a picture!" she said, with
self-reproachful smile. "I, who have talked of shouldering
a musket, and of fighting for Poland."</p>

<p>"We all have our fears at times. I ran away from my
first battle," observed Lambro, without stating from how
many others he had run.</p>

<p>Now that her fears were vanishing, Barbara began to
review the sequel of her recent adventure. She had
waked from a swoon to find herself in the arms of Paul,
and with the words "dearest Barbara" falling upon her
ear. The significance of the expression did not appeal
to her at the time, but now the recalling of it caused her
heart to palpitate. Her color came and went. She
scarcely dared raise her eyes to meet his gaze. Silence
and shyness marked her as their own for the remainder
of the evening.</p>

<p>That night, when the other inmates of the castle were
sleeping, Paul, with lighted lamp, stole off to the bedchamber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
containing the secret panel, and began to explore
the hidden passage and staircase leading to the
mysterious study. Roof, walls, and flooring were of
black oak thick with dust. Every angle had a festoon of
cobwebs. On turning the corner of the staircase Paul
made his first discovery. For some purpose or other a
very long nail had been fixed in the baluster, and not
having been driven far into the wood, it projected in such
a manner that unobservant persons brushing hastily by
would run the risk of tearing their clothing.</p>

<p>Some such accident had happened, for from the head
of this nail there hung a tiny shred of flimsy fabric, which,
upon examination by the light of the lamp, Paul found to
be a fragment of delicate lace,&mdash;lace of a color, texture,
and pattern that he had seen in the charming white costume
with the silver rope-girdle which Jacintha had bestowed
upon Barbara.</p>

<p>This fragment of lace had not become detached while
Barbara herself was turning the staircase, inasmuch as
during her recent adventure she had been wearing a different
dress.</p>

<p>Scrutinizing everywhere, Paul was attracted by a faint
sparkle coming from the dust in a corner of the staircase,
the cause of which proved to be a little article of gold,
obviously a seal. It was circular in shape, and the band
encircling the stone was inscribed with the motto, "<i>Esse
quam videri</i>." The stone itself forming the seal was a
lovely sapphire bearing the image of a double-headed
eagle, beautifully and delicately engraved.</p>

<p>"The royal arms of Poland, as I live!" muttered Paul.
His surprise was naturally very great, but since speculation
as to how the thing came to be there would have
been mere waste of time, he pocketed the treasure-trove
and passed on to the mysterious apartment. This he
found differed in no way from an ordinary study. It
was well lighted and well carpeted. There were numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
shelves with books thereon. There were chairs, a
table, and an escritoire. There were oil-paintings on the
walls. There was really nothing to alarm one in the aspect
of the apartment. Paul did not feel anything of the
strange sensation spoken of by Barbara, and therefore he
felt compelled to ascribe that part of her experience to
the imagination of a timid maiden. The room was locked
and sealed from intrusion: <i>ergo</i>, her argument was there
must be something fearful in it.</p>

<p>Paul turned his attention to the portraits on the wall,
and began with that of the Master who was represented
in the scarlet robes of a cardinal. It was a handsome
face upon which Paul gazed,&mdash;a face full of intellectual
power, with nothing of the mystic visionary about it; the
face of a man of action, a man of ambition, an ecclesiastical
statesman of the type of Richelieu or Mazarin. Paul
waved the lamp to and fro, trying to educe the wicked
expression that had frightened Barbara. True, the
countenance was a cold and haughty character, but he
could not honestly affirm that there was anything sinister
in it. Barbara's fancy was probably due to her hostile
feelings.</p>

<p>He next surveyed the picture of the young lady,&mdash;a
maiden robed in jewelled attire with pearl necklace, diadem,
and sceptre. The resemblance to Barbara was indeed
so marvellous that Paul at first was disposed to
believe that she was the person here represented, and
that the symbols of high rank were decorative fancies
of the artist.</p>

<p>A closer study of the portrait, however, made him
think otherwise. True, every feature corresponded with
Barbara's; hair and eyes were of the same color. The
difference was in the expression. This girl had mischievous
eyes, an arch smile, a radiant look. It was clearly the
face of one leading a happy, unclouded life, whereas
even in Barbara's smile there was always a tinge of melancholy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
as if her mind were shadowed by the memory
of some secret sorrow.</p>

<p>Who was this youthful lady with the smiling eyes? If
she resembled Barbara in face, why not in the height
and shape of her figure? Ah! here without doubt was
the original wearer of that soft, silky dress which had
required no alteration to suit Barbara. The young lady
had perhaps left it as a parting gift to Jacintha for services
rendered by the latter.</p>

<p>She had doubtless come to Castel Nuovo under the
charge of Cardinal Ravenna. Singular that the bedchamber
in which Barbara had slept should have been
previously occupied by a lady her exact counterpart in
face and figure! Was the bedroom that was kept in a
constant state of readiness intended for her use?</p>

<p>He understood now the cause of the amazement on the
part of Lambro and Jacintha when they first beheld Barbara;
they were doubtless startled by her extraordinary
resemblance to their previous guest.</p>

<p>That this lady had traversed the corridor leading to
the cardinal's study was proved by the lace fragment of
her dress adhering to the nail of the staircase, though it
was difficult to assign a reason for this proceeding. A
secret amour was the first idea that suggested itself. But
then, a girl with so lovely a face would never lack youthful
and handsome lovers; it was not likely, therefore,
that she would be guilty of an intrigue with an ecclesiastic
old enough to be her father.</p>

<p>The mystery was bewildering, especially when the diadem
and sceptre were taken into consideration. Lambro
and his consort could explain it, but only by breaking the
oath imposed upon them by the cardinal,&mdash;an oath taken,
if Jacintha's words were true, upon the Holy Sacrament
itself. It must be a weighty secret to require such safeguarding;
nay, more, it was a secret that threatened
Jacintha's own life, as shown by her remark to Lambro:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
"Shall I be permitted to leave here after your
death?"</p>

<p>Musing on all this, Paul turned from the portraits to
examine the rest of the apartment, without discovering
anything of consequence, till, being near the hearth, he
happened to glance downwards. For a moment he stood
as still as a statue; then he stooped and held the lamp
low.</p>

<p>On the polished oak flooring was a dark stain.

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER V<br /><br />

THE RETURN OF THE "MASTER"</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>The "Isola Sacra" mentioned by Paul as an inducement
for Barbara to prolong her stay, was a
small, uninhabited island facing Castel Nuovo at
the distance of about three miles.</p>

<p>The island had often attracted the curiosity of Barbara,
and Paul had promised that he would row her over to it
whenever she felt disposed.</p>

<p>The day named by her for the excursion had come, and
accordingly after breakfast Paul and Barbara descended
to the beach, where they found Lambro getting his sailing-boat
ready for their use. Jacintha followed with a
luncheon-basket on her arm.</p>

<p>"It's no use putting up the sail," remarked the old
Greek. "There's not a breath of wind stirring. You'll
have to row."</p>

<p>Barbara sat by the tiller, where a silken cushion had
been placed for her accommodation. Paul taking the
oars pushed off, giving a smile to Jacintha and a nod
to Lambro.</p>

<p>"At what hour must we expect you back?" asked
Jacintha.</p>

<p>"Not till evening," replied Paul, who set out with the
intention of spending the day upon the island, and of
returning in romantic style beneath the light of the stars.</p>

<p>It was a morning of soft sunlight, lovely and still,&mdash;"the
very bridal of the earth and sky." The heaven was
one deep, living blue, and the sea so smooth that the
mountain peaks, the cliffs, and the towers of the castle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
were reflected on the azure surface of the water as in a
mirror.</p>

<p>"It seems," sighed Barbara to herself, "that my last
day here is to be the fairest."</p>

<p>In happy, dreamy silence she leaned back in her seat,
holding the cords of the tiller, and watching Paul as he
manipulated the oars. Each sweep of his arm lifted the
boat half out of the water, for he was no novice at rowing,
being the captain of the Britannic Aquatic Club at Corfu.</p>

<p>Barbara had never known any pleasure equal to that of
Paul's companionship; and now this pleasure was about
to end&mdash;unless&mdash;unless. And then the questions that
had robbed her of sleep during the night began again their
work of torture. Why had he called her "dearest Barbara"?
Was it a mere transitory outburst of affection
on his part, evoked by her helpless state? Would he
place her on shipboard at Zara, and, leaving her to go on
her way alone, return to Corfu? The thought alarmed
her; she grew faint at the idea of a future without Paul.</p>

<p>She contrived to mask her emotion beneath a calm exterior,
and as Paul caught her smiles, he little thought
how her heart was pulsating to the very tune of love.
She even volunteered to take one of the oars.</p>

<p>"What? and but just recovered from a fever! Besides,
you will blister your fingers."</p>

<p>But Barbara was not to be dissuaded. She took the
oar, and, never having held one before, behaved like a true
novice. She failed to keep time with her partner, and her
oar either did not strike the water, or striking, deluged
the boat with spray, till Paul began to consider whether it
would not be wise to suspend the luncheon-basket from
the masthead. Strange how man will tolerate in woman
blundering such as he would not tolerate for a moment in
his fellowman! Barbara's incompetence at the oar was
delightful in Paul's eyes.</p>

<p>"I'd better give it up," she cried laughingly. "Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
boat is performing such extraordinary gyrations that the
steamer from Zara, which I can see in the distance, will
be coming up to ascertain the cause."</p>

<p>So Paul resumed possession of the oar, and rowing
onward in gallant style, reached the island, and ran the
boat in upon the sands of a little bay.</p>

<p>Isola Sacra was not more than two miles in length, and
about one in breadth; nevertheless, within its limited
space there was considerable diversity. There were cliffs
rising vertically from the water; there were strips of
yellow sand by the sea; there were woods, and a silver-flashing
stream. And most attractive sight of all, the
remains of a Grecian temple crowning the summit of a
small eminence, the marble columns glowing brilliantly
white against a background of dark cypresses.</p>

<p>Towards this edifice they slowly made their way.</p>

<p>"To whom was this temple raised?" asked Barbara,
as they stood within the ruin.</p>

<p>"It was the shrine of Eros."</p>

<p>The Temple of Love! What more appropriate place
could there be for an avowal?</p>

<p>"The god of love," she murmured softly. "And his
altar and shrine are fallen!"</p>

<p>"But not his worship," replied Paul. "That is
eternal."</p>

<p>Barbara averted her eyes, and trembled with a sweet
feeling.</p>

<p>They sat down on a fallen column beneath the shadow
cast by a graceful palm. Before them lay the bay they
had just crossed,&mdash;a blue semicircular mirror, the Illyrian
mountains forming a picturesque background.</p>

<p>Paul and Barbara sat drinking in the deep beauty of
the scene. In the boat their conversation had been lively
and unrestrained, but now a silence lay on both.</p>

<p>Barbara was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I think," she murmured dreamily, gazing at the sky,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
"that the loveliest part of heaven must be above this
isle."</p>

<p>Paul glanced at her inquiringly, not quite comprehending
her remark.</p>

<p>"The Arabian poets," she continued, "assert that the
fairest spot on earth is situated beneath the fairest spot
in heaven, the earthly, as it were, being a reflex of the
heavenly."</p>

<p>"A pretty idea!" said Paul. "With me, however, the
fairest place on earth is not a fixed, but a moveable point."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Barbara inquiringly.</p>

<p>"To me the fairest place is wherever you happen to be.
Do I make myself clear, dearest Barbara, or shall I say
more?"</p>

<p>Barbara tried to speak, but the words would not come.
There was no need for speech, however. A light that
would have made the plainest features beautiful stole over
her face. She placed her little hand within his, and by
that act Paul knew that she was his for ever.</p>

<p>He drew her to his embrace, where she reclined supremely
happy and yet afraid to raise her eyes to his.</p>

<p>"Barbara," he whispered, "you have never yet told me
the story of your life. Will you not do so now?"</p>

<p>There was nothing Barbara would not have done to
please Paul. She was silent for a few moments, as if
collecting her thoughts, and then, still within the circle of
his arms, she began in a voice as low and silvery as if
coming from dreamland.</p>

<p>"If I have been truly told, I was born at Warsaw in
1826, and shall therefore be nineteen years of age next
month.</p>

<p>"My parents I never knew; indeed I am even ignorant
of their names and station in life. I had been adopted in
infancy by a noble Polish lady, the Countess Lorenska,&mdash;a
youthful widow, who, although kindness itself, was
always mute to any remark relative to my parentage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
though, as you may guess, the question as to my origin
troubled me but little in those early days.</p>

<p>"The Countess Lorenska was very rich, her mansion at
Warsaw a palace, and the ladies and gentlemen who attended
her salons vied with each other in caressing and
spoiling me. I had all that wealth could supply, including
learned masters, under whose tuition I began that
course of instruction which you have characterized as
peculiar for a woman.</p>

<p>"My adoptive mother, herself well educated, superintended
my studies, but the lesson she seemed chiefly desirous
of inculcating is contained in almost the first
sentence I was taught to utter,&mdash;'I will always love
Poland and the Catholic Church. I will never cease to
oppose Russia and the Greek Faith.' This vow was part
of my prayers morning and evening, and such is the force
of habit that I still continue to say it.</p>

<p>"As you may suppose, Polish history formed part, and
a very important part, of my curriculum. My blood
glowed as I listened to the story of my country's wrongs.
But indeed I did not require the voice of past history to
teach me patriotism. What was happening all round
was sufficient. I was between five and six years of age
when the uprising at Warsaw took place, and the unjust
and terrible reprisals exacted by the conquering Russians
have left an impression upon my mind which no length
of time can ever efface.</p>

<p>"The war passed, and an era of tranquillity, or rather
of torpor, followed.</p>

<p>"Among those who frequented the assemblies held by
the Countess Lorenska&mdash;assemblies that partook more of
a political than of a social character&mdash;was a young priest
of Italian origin, named Pasqual Ravenna, who exercised
considerable influence over the mind of my adoptive
mother, inasmuch as he was her father-confessor.</p>

<p>"One night during a brilliant entertainment I stole out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
of the <i>salle de danse</i> into the moonlit gardens without, in
order to avoid waltzing with a silly fellow who was my
special aversion. I secreted myself in a quiet arbor. On
the other side of the shrubbery two persons were slowly
pacing to and fro, and earnestly conversing. I recognized
the voices of Countess Lorenska and Father Ravenna. I
had no wish to hear what they were saying; indeed, I was
too much pre-occupied with my would-be partner, whom
I could see through the leaves vainly trying to find me,
to pay much attention to them, but still fragments of their
dialogue reached my ears.</p>

<p>"'She must be removed,' Ravenna was saying; 'she
is too near'&mdash;I did not catch the word&mdash;'to be safe.
He often visits Warsaw. If she should be seen and recognized
by him, our plan would be frustrated. Besides,
she is growing. We must take care that she forms no
love-attachment.'</p>

<p>"The countess laughed.</p>

<p>"'How absurd! She is too young for such notions.'</p>

<p>"'She is only twelve, 'tis true, but she is more advanced
physically and mentally than most girls of fifteen.
She will be safer in a convent till&mdash;till&mdash;her restoration,'
he added, as if hesitating for the choice of a word.</p>

<p>"'If you say so, it must be so,' said the countess with a
sigh, 'though it will almost break my heart to part with
her. Your instructions have been carried out to the very
letter. She will always be a devout Catholic, and patriotically
Polish.'</p>

<p>"'So far&mdash;good,' replied Ravenna.</p>

<p>"They both moved off at this point, and not till then
did it dawn upon me that they were speaking of myself.</p>

<p>"Next morning I was summoned by the countess,
whom I found seated with Father Ravenna.</p>

<p>"'Barbara,' she said, 'you are going to live in a convent
for the next six years, where you will continue the
studies you have begun here. Father Ravenna will conduct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
you to the convent. And do not forget that if I
should die he will be your guardian, and you must obey
his commandments, however strange they may appear.'</p>

<p>"I cried very much on parting from my adoptive
mother.</p>

<p>"'Courage! It is for the good of Poland,' said the
countess, as she folded me in a last embrace.</p>

<p>"I failed to understand how Poland could be benefited
by poor simple me, still less how my six years' residence
in a convent was to accomplish that end.</p>

<p>"Under the conduct of Ravenna I travelled southward
by easy stages. I began to forget my grief in the novelty
of the scenes that succeeded each other. We entered
Dalmatia, the country growing in grandeur and wildness
with every mile of our journey.</p>

<p>"At last we reached our destination,&mdash;the Convent of
the Holy Sacrament, situated in an isolated valley amid
the loftiest peaks of the Dinaric Alps,&mdash;and here Ravenna
left me after a long conference with the abbess.</p>

<p>"My life in the convent was a very pleasant one.
Being the youngest person in the establishment, I became
a sort of pet with the nuns. Though I took part in the
devotional services of the convent, I did not wear the religious
habit, nor did I partake of the food of the other
inmates. My fare was more delicate than theirs; I wore
costly dresses; I had my own dining-chamber with a
nun to wait upon me. In short, if I had been a princess
they could not have paid me more deference and attention.</p>

<p>"My studies were mainly directed by three monks
from a neighboring establishment, one of whom, so the
nuns asserted, had been a leading statesman of Austria,
who, for some offence, had been ordered by the Kaiser
to retire to a monastery; be that as it may, his was a
mind well stored with political knowledge, and Metternich
himself could not have taught me more of the secrets
of contemporary history.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"My second year's residence in the convent was saddened
by the tidings of the Countess Lorenska's death,&mdash;to
me a calamity in more ways than one, for it made
Father Ravenna my guardian, and him I had always
viewed with secret dislike, if not with fear.</p>

<p>"Now that I was growing older and more thoughtful,
the question as to my parentage began to trouble me.
Who was I? why kept ignorant of my origin? why put
to this course of study? The abbess Teresa averred that
all would ultimately be made clear by my guardian Ravenna,
who would remove me from the convent as soon
as I was eighteen.</p>

<p>"On the eve of my eighteenth birthday Ravenna appeared,
no longer a simple priest. His scarlet robes and
the title 'Your Eminence,' addressed to him by the abbess,
showed that he had risen to the dignity of a cardinal.</p>

<p>"He held an interview with me in the quietude of my
own apartment. He had not seen me for six years, remember,
and of course during that time I had grown
from girlhood into womanhood.</p>

<p>"I noticed that as soon as he had set eyes on me he
gave a start. I am certain that he murmured 'How
like'! During the whole of the interview he walked to
and fro, seemingly intent on studying my face and figure,
now in one light, now in another, conduct which very
much embarrassed me.</p>

<p>"'Know, my daughter,' he began, 'that your father,
supposed by you to be dead, is really living.'</p>

<p>"You can imagine my surprise at this statement.</p>

<p>"'Then why does he not acknowledge me?'</p>

<p>"'He has lived under the belief that you died as soon
as born.'</p>

<p>"'He knows differently now?'</p>

<p>"'I have informed him of his error.'</p>

<p>"'And he has sent you to bring me to him?' I cried
joyfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>"'Alas! there's a difficulty at present in the way of
your meeting each other. Accustomed for eighteen years
to regard you as dead, he listens with scepticism to the
story that you are living. Nay, more, he avers the statement
to be a conspiracy on my part."</p>

<p>"'A conspiracy!' I repeated wonderingly.</p>

<p>"'He has another daughter by a second wife, your
half-sister, of whom he has grown passionately fond.
You, as the elder, stand in the light of her interests;
whatever she thought herself entitled to now devolves
upon you. For this reason he seeks to deny your relationship
to him.'</p>

<p>"'They wrong me by such thoughts,' I cried. 'I ask
not for wealth, but for affection.'</p>

<p>"'Tut, tut,' returned the cardinal. 'We have clear
proofs of your filiation and legitimacy. We shall compel
him to acknowledge you. You shall not be deprived of
your rights.'</p>

<p>"'How came my father to think me dead?'</p>

<p>"'I believe I am responsible for that error,' he said,
with a smile that told me some interested motive lay at
the root of his deception.</p>

<p>"I was unable to control my indignation.</p>

<p>"'You!' I cried. 'A holy cardinal the author of a
falsehood that has separated a father from his daughter
for eighteen years, and that will perhaps keep them apart
forever! I honor my father for his present distrust of
you. If you lied to him in my infancy, what wonder that
he should deem you to be lying now?'</p>

<p>"The cardinal waved his hand deprecatingly.
'The end sanctifies the means, and my end is a noble
one.'</p>

<p>"Curiosity overcame my anger. Despite my aversion
to the cardinal, I could not refrain from plying him with
questions; the names of my father and my sister; their
station in life; their abode, and the like.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>"But Cardinal Ravenna remained inflexibly uncommunicative.
It was in vain that I knelt before him, and
with tears entreated that he would let me see my father
and sister face to face.</p>

<p>"'My presence may move them,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Your presence, my daughter, would create confusion,'
he said coldly. 'Leave to me the task of winning
for you a splendid heritage. Till then you must remain
in this convent.'</p>

<p>"And with that Ravenna took his departure.</p>

<p>"The new knowledge imparted by the cardinal contributed
rather to embitter than to cheer my life. It was not
a pleasant reflection that somewhere in the world I had
both father and sister who had never seen me, and who,
apparently, had no desire to see me.</p>

<p>"For this state of affairs the cardinal, according to his
own statement, was responsible, and I hated him for it.
He cared nothing for the feelings of parent and child;
his only object in bringing the two together was to advance
his own interests; he would exact a price both
from the father and from the new daughter.</p>

<p>"I resolved to cast off the self-constituted guardianship
of Cardinal Ravenna. I would quit the convent,
and, making my way to Warsaw, endeavor to discover
the friends of my girlhood.</p>

<p>"But when I conferred with Abbess Teresa she told
me kindly, yet firmly, that this could not be; the cardinal
had left strict orders that I must be detained till his
return.</p>

<p>"From that time my freedom ceased. The walks
which I had been accustomed to take outside the convent
in the company of two attendant nuns were stopped.
The cloister gardens were open to me; once I had
deemed them spacious, now they seemed very narrow.
Though treated kindly in other ways I knew myself to
be a prisoner watched by innumerable eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"The cardinal came not to release me. And thus eight
months passed,&mdash;the most melancholy time I had ever
known.</p>

<p>"At last the porter, Bulgar, with whom I had always
been a favorite, listened to my pleading, and one dark
night, by preconcerted arrangement with me, he left the
convent-gate unlocked, and I stole forth.</p>

<p>"But my flight might soon be intercepted. A few miles
to the north of the convent, on the Bosnian frontier, is a
fortress garrisoned by Austrian troops. I remembered
that once when a poor nun longing for her freedom
again, had run away, the Abbess had obtained aid from
this fortress. The commandant sent out a troop, which,
scouring the country around, returned with the fugitive
after a three days' search. Devoted to the cardinal's interests,
Abbess Teresa would certainly make a similar
requisition in my case.</p>

<p>"Still I had the advantage of several hours' start, and,
trusting to heaven for aid, I fled onward through the
darkness. Zara, sixty miles to the northwest, was the
haven of my desires. For two days I journeyed on foot,
sleeping the first night in the woods.</p>

<p>"At the end of the second day&mdash;but you know the rest.</p>

<p>"O Paul," she murmured, with a soft pressure of her
arms, "whom have I in the world but you? And to
think that I at first repulsed you when you met me that
night in the wood!"</p>

<p>And here Barbara, having finished her story, looked
up at Paul.</p>

<p>"Why so grave?" she asked, with a smile that masked
a certain misgiving on her part.</p>

<p>"In the very act of asking you to be my wife, Barbara,
I feel compelled to pause. Your story is so suggestive.
Supposing you should prove to be a rich heiress, or a
peeress, or," he continued, his mind reverting to the portrait
of the lady with the diadem, "shall we ascend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
higher, and say a princess?&mdash;you will make a mesalliance
by marrying one who has nothing but a cloak and
a sword."</p>

<p>"Dreams, Paul, dreams."</p>

<p>"Nay, the interest taken in you by the cardinal proves
that you are a person either of rank or wealth, or possibly
both."</p>

<p>"I place no faith in the cardinal's story. Doubtless,
there does exist somewhere a rich Polish noble, whose
infant daughter was lost or stolen away eighteen or nineteen
years ago, but I do not believe that I am she, though
Ravenna would have me play the rôle of the missing
heiress. But even if I were an empress&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Barbara paused in her utterance.</p>

<p>"Yes; if you were an empress&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Cannot you guess the rest?"</p>

<p>"You would be my wife. Is that so, Barbara?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Paul," she replied, simply. "None but you."</p>

<p>Paul raised her beautiful face upward to his own, and
looked down into the light of her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Barbara, I have loved you from the first moment of
seeing you."</p>

<p>Barbara could not truthfully say that her love had
begun so early. The knowledge of it had come upon her
perhaps a month ago.</p>

<p>"I wish I had known it. A month ago!" he added
ruefully. "Just think of the kisses I have missed!"</p>

<p>"Nothing prevents you, Paul, from repairing lost
opportunities."</p>

<p>Who could have resisted the witchery of those lips
raised so temptingly at that moment? Not Paul,
certainly.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The dusk of twilight was stealing over the island.
The stars were beginning to glimmer through the violet
air above.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"It is time to return," said Paul, leading Barbara
towards the boat.</p>

<p>"The mantilla!" she exclaimed, suddenly stopping
short in her walk. "I left it in the ruins. I must go
back for it, since it is Jacintha's. And my diamond
brooch is fastened to it."</p>

<p>"You are tired, Barbara. Remain here. I will fetch
it."</p>

<p>"Do not be long."</p>

<p>"Can you not bear a parting of five minutes?" he
asked with a smile.</p>

<p>"One minute is too long, Paul."</p>

<p>Seating Barbara upon a fragment of rock, Paul hastened
over the grassy upland in the direction of the classic
ruin, which was distant about a quarter of a mile from
the shore.</p>

<p>At the edge of a small wood that intervened between
himself and the temple, he paused for a moment to listen
to Barbara, who was singing in a sweet plaintive voice
the hymn to the Virgin accustomed to be sung in her
convent at vesper hour.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Fading, still fading, the last beam is shining.</p>
<p>Ave Maria! day is declining:</p>
<p>Safety and innocence fly with the light:</p>
<p>Temptation and danger walk forth with the night:</p>
<p>From the fall of the shade till the matin shall chime</p>
<p>Shield us from peril, and save us from crime.</p>
<p class="i4"><i>Ave Maria, audi nos!</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>She formed a pretty picture as she sat there alone by
the dusky-blue sea in the faint starlight, her dainty white-robed
figure clearly outlined against the black rock.</p>

<p>"I'm the luckiest mortal living," muttered Paul. "By
heaven! won't the fellows be dumb with surprise and envy
when I mount the jetty-stairs at Corfu with Barbara upon
my arm! And as for uncle, always an admirer of the
ladies, he'll fairly worship her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>He pictured Colonel Graysteel's look of admiration,
and caught his whispered aside: "By Jove, Paul,
where did you find this lovely vestal? Lucky dog! no
wonder you have stayed away so long!"</p>

<p>Barbara had followed Paul with her eyes, and now, on
seeing him pause, she waved her hand prettily, while he,
like a gallant lover, waved his in turn. Then, eager to
despatch his quest and to return to her, he plunged into
the wood, and Barbara was lost to view.</p>

<p>On reaching the temple, Paul quickly found the mantilla,
but the brooch which should have been attached to
it was missing. As the ornament was a valuable one he
did not like to return without it, and he therefore began
a search in the fading light.</p>

<p>Having spent ten minutes without success, he resolved
to quit the task lest Barbara, sitting by the lonely shore,
should become nervous at his long delay.</p>

<p>As he rose to his feet he looked upward, and found
that the stars were invisible. A white mist like a ghost
was floating over the isle.</p>

<p>Snatching up the mantilla, he dashed down through
the woodland, and, but for the murmur of the sea, which
served to direct his course, he would most certainly have
missed his way.</p>

<p>As he drew near to the beach he called upon Barbara
by name, but received no answer. This was puzzling, inasmuch
as he was near the place where he had left her.
Near? He was at the exact spot. There was the crag
upon which she had been seated a few minutes previously,
but of Barbara herself not a trace was visible.</p>

<p>Vainly did his eyes seek to pierce the veil of mist that
hung around; every object more than a few feet distant
was hidden from view.</p>

<p>The melancholy lapping of the waves over the sand was
the only sound that broke the stillness.</p>

<p>Where was Barbara? Ah! alarmed perhaps by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
mist and by his long absence, she had left the shore to
seek him, and had missed her way to the ruin. He would
go back at once and find her.</p>

<p>He had just turned to retrace his steps, when suddenly
from out the mist that overhung the sea there came a
strange voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>All ready? Give way, then. To Castel Nuovo!</i>"</p>

<p>The words were immediately followed by the dip and
roll of oars,&mdash;sounds that sent a thrill of horror through
Paul's heart. In one swift moment he realized what was
happening.</p>

<p>The Austrian gendarmerie sent by the convent authorities
had come at last! Come? ay, and were going with
their purpose accomplished!</p>

<p>Barbara, silent, perhaps because in a swoon, was in the
hands of enemies who were carrying her off, and though
her captors were but a few yards distant, he was unable
to render her any aid. The suddenness, the stillness, the
mysteriousness of it all was more appalling than the act
of abduction itself.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour had not yet elapsed since Barbara had
pressed her glowing lips to his. And now&mdash;and now&mdash;was
ever lover's dream cut short so awfully and
abruptly as this?</p>

<p>"Barbara! Barbara!" he cried in agony. "If you are
there, speak."</p>

<p>Was he mistaken, or did he really hear his own name
pronounced by a voice faintly sounding, as if the speaker's
head were muffled within the folds of a cloak?</p>

<p>Following his first impulse, he dashed into the sea
towards the point whence came the sound of the oars.
Like a madman he leaped and plunged forward through
mist and water with the desire of arresting the progress
of the receding boat. Vain hope! He did not even obtain
a glimpse of the boat, much less come up with it.</p>

<p>Not till the water surged breast-high around him did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
he pause, and then he stood mechanically listening to the
sound of the oar-sweep as it died away in the distance.</p>

<p>Recovering from his stupor he waded back to land, and
sought the place where he had left his own boat.</p>

<p>It was gone!</p>

<p>It had either been taken in tow by Barbara's captors,
or cast adrift in order to prevent him from giving trouble
by following them.</p>

<p>The island had become his prison, inasmuch as he had
no way of crossing to the mainland except by swimming,
and though he might not have shrunk from a three-mile
course in smooth water, the same distance across a sea-channel
traversed by currents and covered by a thick fog
was a very different matter.</p>

<p>Though every moment of detention diminished his
hope of effecting Barbara's rescue, yet here he was, absolutely
helpless, dependent for his release upon the
chance passing of some fishing-boat.</p>

<p>He did not doubt&mdash;he could not doubt&mdash;that the abduction
of Barbara was the work of Cardinal Ravenna,
who had probably been apprised by Abbess Teresa of
the flight of his youthful <i>protégé</i>. It was not likely that
he would restore her to the Convent of the Holy Sacrament;
some more secure establishment would be chosen,
and, when Barbara was once immured by the authority
of a powerful ecclesiastic, it would be difficult, if not impossible,
to reach her. The only consoling feature in
this dark affair was that the success of the cardinal's
scheme, whatever its character, hung upon Barbara's
life; so far she was safe, but the thought of the sufferings
to which she might be subjected, in order to extort
submission, drove Paul's mind to the verge of frenzy.</p>

<p>At midnight the mist began to lift almost as suddenly
as it had come on. The whole blue arch of heaven became
revealed. The moon was now at its full, and the
cold, pallid light shone over the island with its dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
woods, and its ivory-white temple on the hill-top, the
fallen shrine of love.</p>

<p>Paul mounted this hill and glanced over the sea in all
directions; but his hope of seeing some barque in the
vicinity of the isle was immediately extinguished. Not
a sail was visible.</p>

<p>He had brought to the island a pair of field-glasses,
and these he now directed over the channel that separated
him from the Dalmatian mainland. The light was insufficient
for the taking of distant observations; nevertheless,
he came to the conclusion that a tiny light visible
at a certain point on the coast marked the position of
Castel Nuovo; and, aware that Barbara's captors must
long ere this have reached their destination, this light
became an object of deep interest. Without any reason
whatever to guide him, he took up the belief that it
marked the room in which she was detained for the
night, and impressed by this fancy, he kept his eyes fixed
upon it as wistfully as if it were the face of Barbara
herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly the light vanished.</p>

<p>A very simple occurrence, and yet Paul had no sooner
noted it than there came over him a trembling and a
horror as great as if the extinction of that light had likewise
involved the extinction of Barbara.</p>

<p>His mind was either playing him strange tricks, or else
his hearing had become more than ordinarily acute.
Sounds on the opposite coast seemed close at hand,&mdash;sounds
of an eerie character.</p>

<p>The deep silence of the night was first broken by the
fitful ringing of church bells; immediately afterwards
came a series of reverberations which Paul could compare
only with the rattling echoes produced by the discharge
of artillery among lofty hills; and next there
floated over the sea a prolonged cry like the wild shriek
of some captured town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>Then all was still again.</p>

<p>What had happened along that moonlit coast?</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Night waned. Morning dawned with all the fair
golden glory of that southern clime.</p>

<p>On the shore of Isola Sacra stood a man, his gaze fixed
eastward as it had been fixed ever since the growing light
had enabled him to perceive distant objects with any degree
of distinctness.</p>

<p>The British regiment at Corfu would have failed to
recognize their captain in this man with his wild air,
blood-shot eyes, and haggard face staring continually
over the sea.</p>

<p>For the twentieth time his shaking hands raised the
field-glasses.</p>

<p>Whenever he turned the binoculars to that point of
coast where Castel Nuovo should have been, he found
that Castel Nuovo was not there. Focus the glasses as
he would, he could not detect a trace of the edifice. The
blue sea seemed to be rolling over the site!</p>

<p>In like manner other landmarks along the coast had
disappeared, notably a white lighthouse a few miles to the
north of Castel Nuovo. The mountains, too, seemed to
present an outline differing from that of the previous day.</p>

<p>Then the truth in all its ghastliness broke upon Paul,
and, strong man though he was, he dropped upon the
sands as one dead.</p>

<p>The explanation was simple and terrible.</p>

<p>During the night an earthquake had devastated the
coast of Dalmatia; towns had been laid in ruins; scores
of people had perished; and, among a crowd of minor
catastrophes enumerated by the "Zara Times" of that
week, was the complete submergence of a picturesque
edifice, erected in the fourteenth century by the Doge
Marino Faliero, and known by the name of Castel
Nuovo!</p>

<h2 class="p6">THE STORY</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
TWO YEARS AFTERWARDS</h3>

<p>"Here's to the Princess of Czernova!" cried
Noel Trevisa,&mdash;a dark-eyed, handsome young
fellow,&mdash;raising his glass as he spoke. "Have
you seen her yet, Paul?"</p>

<p>Captain Cressingham, or to use the new name assumed
by him on the death of a relative, Captain Woodville,
smiled at the enthusiasm with which his friend proposed
the toast.</p>

<p>"I entered Slavowitz only last evening," he replied,
"and have already been asked that question six times.
It seems to be the first one put to a visitor."</p>

<p>"And when you have seen her you will cease to wonder
at the pride of the Czernovese in their princess. Natalie
Lilieska is more than beautiful,&mdash;she is Beauty's self."</p>

<p>This interchange took place on an elevated balcony of
the Hôtel de Varsovie, the principal establishment of its
kind in Slavowitz, the picturesque capital of the old
Polish principality of Czernova.</p>

<p>Between Paul and his companion stood a marble-topped
table decorated with a bottle of Chartreuse and a
box of cigars, and in the quiet enjoyment of these luxuries
the two Englishmen yielded themselves to lazy
abandon in the soft sunshine of a spring morning, watching
the gay current of Czernovese life as it flowed along
the boulevard beneath their feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>Two years had elapsed since the night when Barbara
had been carried off to perish, as Paul believed, in the
engulfing of Castel Nuovo.</p>

<p>A fishing-barque passing by next morning had taken
Paul from the island; its arrival was timely, for the
vessel had scarcely gone half-a-mile when the sea became
violently agitated, and Isola Sacra itself disappeared
beneath the waves. The frightened fishermen,
perceiving that the force of the earthquake was not yet
spent, refused to put in on the Dalmatian coast, believing
it to be safer on water than on land. For four-and-twenty
hours they kept out on the deep, disembarking
only when they deemed the peril past.</p>

<p>The moment Paul touched land he made his way to
the vicinity of Castel Nuovo, and found its site covered
by the sea. Must he believe that the last resting-place
of Barbara was fathoms deep below these waves? He
rowed to and fro over the spot, peering through the
singularly transparent water, and sometimes fancying
that he could discern the ghostly outline of towers and
battlements.</p>

<p>Had Barbara really been lodged at Castel Nuovo during
the night of the earthquake, or at some other place?</p>

<p>Inquiries carried on by him within a wide area around
Castel Nuovo yielded no tidings as to the missing maiden.
Barbara, Jacintha, Lambro, were like the shadows of a
past dream.</p>

<p>Blank despair settled upon Paul. Life seemed scarcely
worth living.</p>

<p>Then came news that the British troops stationed at
Corfu had been ordered to India to suppress a rising
among the hill-tribes of the frontier.</p>

<p>Paul, whose first impulse had been to resign his commission,
now decided to accompany his regiment lest his
retirement on the eve of war should be attributed to a
spirit of cowardice. The fierce thrill of fighting might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
help to drown the memory of Barbara&mdash;for a time.
And since life without her was hard to bear, he cherished
the hope that an Afghan spear might give him the
death he desired.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Corfu, Paul learned that, owing to
the death of a wealthy aunt, he was now master of considerable
landed property in Kent, subject to the condition
that he should assume his relative's name of
Woodville. Paul mechanically acquiesced, and was
henceforth gazetted as "Captain Woodville."</p>

<p>"Cressingham or Woodville, what matters?" he said.
"Soon to be a little dust, I hope."</p>

<p>This legal formality over, he hurried off to India.</p>

<p>In the campaign that followed he did not die; on the
contrary, he lived to gain a brilliant reputation,&mdash;a reputation
destined, though he foresaw it not, to stand him
in good stead during a political crisis of the future.</p>

<p>In a small border-fortress he found himself one of a
garrison of four hundred men besieged by an Afghan
force twenty times its own number.</p>

<p>It was winter, and the mountain-passes were filled with
snow.</p>

<p>Weeks must elapse ere relief could come. Scantily
provided with artillery, their provisions running out,
sleepless from incessant attacks, the heroic little band
kept grimly to the work.</p>

<p>Early in the siege the major in command, with two or
three officers, yielding to a spirit of fear strange in
English soldiers, proposed in council an unconditional
surrender.</p>

<p>"We were sent here," said Paul, darkly and haughtily,
"to hold the fortress, not to cede it. If you do not know
your duty, Major, there are those who will teach it you.
I will shoot the first man that talks again of surrender,
be he commandant or be he private."</p>

<p>And without delay Paul took strong measures. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
put his own superior, together with the recreant officers,
under arrest, and he himself took the command. Upon
this there arose from the garrison, when informed of
what had taken place, a ringing British cheer that startled
the enemy in their distant entrenchments.</p>

<p>Paul henceforth was the soul of the fight,&mdash;at the
head of every sortie, charging the enemy regardless of
their number. The garrison attributed his conduct to
sheer devilry; it was, in truth, the despairing mood of
a man bent on finding death.</p>

<p>Ever amid the clash of arms he seemed to see before
him the beautiful face of her whom he had lost, and
scarcely conscious of the fact, he would cry "Barbara!
Barbara!" to the bewilderment of his men. The wild
Afghans shrank back in dismay whenever the "Feringhee
devil" turned his dripping sabre in their direction,
deeming the "bar-bar-a" uttered by him to be a magic
spell capable of dealing death around.</p>

<p>When at last the long-desired relief came, and the
story of the heroic defence of Tajapore became known
to the world, Paul found that he had unintentionally become
a famous person.</p>

<p>At the end of his second year in India Paul made a
remarkable discovery.</p>

<p>Up till that time he had entertained the belief that
Cardinal Ravenna had perished in the Dalmatian earthquake,
though strange as it may appear, he had not
thought of putting his opinion to the proof by ascertaining
whether the Sacred College had actually lost a member
in the year '45. However, being in the club-room
at Poonah one day, he happened to be glancing over a
continental newspaper, when his eye was caught by the
following paragraph,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Pope has been pleased to appoint Cardinal Ravenna
to the archiepiscopal see of Slavowitz."</p>

<p>Paul laid down the paper trembling with new hope.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
If the cardinal had survived the earthquake, why should
not Barbara likewise? Could it be that she was really
alive?</p>

<p>Till that moment Paul had been ignorant of the name
of Slavowitz, but a reference to a dictionary of geography
informed him that it was the capital of Czernova,
the latter being a small independent state on the
borders of Austria and Russia.</p>

<p>He resolved to set off immediately for this principality,
for the purpose of interviewing the dark-dealing cardinal
in whose breast was contained the secret of Barbara's
history.</p>

<p>Two years' assiduous attention to duty easily earned for
Paul a long furlough. He quitted India, arrived at
Alexandria, and took ship for Constantinople; thence
travelling post-haste day and night he threaded the passes
of the Balkans, crossed the Danube, traversed the forests
of the Carpathians, and finally arrived at Slavowitz late
at night, where he was much disappointed to learn that
the new archbishop was absent from his see, having gone
on a journey to Rome, his return, however, being daily
expected.</p>

<p>Paul determined to await his coming.</p>

<p>On this, his first morning at Slavowitz, while gazing
from the balcony of his hotel, he caught sight of an old
college chum in the person of Noel Trevisa.</p>

<p>Paul immediately cried to him by name, and in a moment
more the two friends were sitting together renewing
old memories; and great were Trevisa's surprise and
admiration on learning that the Captain Woodville whose
name had become familiar to all Europe, was the same as
his old friend, Paul Cressingham.</p>

<p>"And what has brought you to this city?" inquired
Paul, when the other had drunk his toast to the fair
ruler of Czernova.</p>

<p>"This city is my adopted home. Formerly professor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
of English at the university of Slavowitz, I am now
private secretary to the loveliest princess in Europe, and
occupy a suite of apartments in the palace."</p>

<p>"Accept my congratulations. How did you, a foreigner
here, obtain the post?"</p>

<p>"Thaddeus the Good&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Was, my dear fellow&mdash;'was' is the word, inasmuch
as he is no more&mdash;the late Prince of Czernova, her
Highness's father. He died six months ago."</p>

<p>"I understand. Proceed."</p>

<p>"Prince Thaddeus, about two years ago, offered me
the post of tutor to his daughter Natalie. I was to
instruct her in English Literature and English Constitutional
History. Naturally I did not refuse so charming
a student. When a few months later her secretary resigned
through ill-health, the princess installed me in his
place, where I am proud to be. I wish I could persuade
you too, Paul, to take service under her Highness."</p>

<p>"What! Accept command in a toy army destined
never to smell powder! All thanks to you, Noel, but I
prefer to remain with the old Twenty-fourth."</p>

<p>"That's a pity, for the princess is very desirous of
officering her army with men experienced in warfare.
And of all nationalities she seems to prefer the English.
On her return from Dalmatia&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From where?" interrupted Paul, sharply.</p>

<p>"From Dalmatia. Why shouldn't she go there?"
retorted Trevisa, aggressively.</p>

<p>"Why not, indeed? And how long is it since she
returned from Dalmatia?"</p>

<p>"About two years."</p>

<p>"Ha! proceed."</p>

<p>Paul's strange manner led Trevisa to wonder whether
his head had not become affected by his two years' residence
in the tropics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, as I was about to say, after her return from
Dalmatia, one of the first acts of the princess was to
appoint a new uniform for her body-guard. Accordingly
sketches of the various costumes worn in the different
European armies were laid before her. You, my dear
Paul, ought to feel honored by her selection."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Because the uniform she chose is one so like your
own that for my part I fail to detect the difference. As
you walk through the streets of Slavowitz you will certainly
be taken for one of her <i>corps du garde</i>, known as
the Blue Legion."</p>

<p>A strange suspicion entered Paul's mind.</p>

<p>"How old is the Princess Natalie?"</p>

<p>"She celebrated her nineteenth birthday last week."</p>

<p>"Barbara, if she were living, would be twenty-one by
this time," murmured Paul to himself; and then aloud
he added: "And you say that the princess is very
beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Be thyself the judge," smiled Trevisa. "Within a
quarter of an hour from now she will pass along this
boulevard on her way to the Mazeppa Gardens. From
the balcony here you will have a good view of her."</p>

<p>"Haven't you her portrait upon you?"</p>

<p>"At present I have with me no other likeness than this."</p>

<p>And here Trevisa drew forth a gold-piece, bright as
if fresh from the mint.</p>

<p>"The new coinage, issued this week. Reverse&mdash;the
double-headed eagle, the ancient arms of Poland. Obverse&mdash;the
profile of the princess with the legend '<i>Natalia,
Princeps Czern. Amat. Patr.</i>' 'Natalie, Princess
of Czernova, Lover of her Country.' Did the goddess
Athene carry a more dainty head than this?"</p>

<p>Paul took the coin, glanced at the obverse, and then
sat in a state wavering between belief and unbelief.</p>

<p>Was this golden disc really stamped with the head of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Barbara? So it seemed to Paul. At any rate, if her
profile had been engraved on metal with due regard to
fidelity, it would have differed little or nothing from
that on the coin.</p>

<p>Then a new idea seized him, and one more consonant
with probability. Was this the profile of the maiden
whose portrait he had seen in the cardinal's secret study
at Castel Nuovo&mdash;the maiden with the laughing eyes,
the sceptre and the diadem?</p>

<p>"A graceful head, a very graceful head," he remarked,
returning the coin. "I should like to hear more of the
fair lady."</p>

<p>"As many questions as you please."</p>

<p>"First, where did the Princess Natalie pass her childhood
and youth?"</p>

<p>"Here in the city of Slavowitz and its vicinity. Of
course she has had her travels like the rest of us, and
has visited different European countries, but, speaking
generally, she was reared and educated in the Vistula
Palace, whose towers you can see rising behind yon
cathedral spire."</p>

<p>Clearly not Barbara, for Barbara had spent her earlier
years at Warsaw, her later in the Illyrian Convent of
the Holy Sacrament.</p>

<p>"And what of her visit to Dalmatia?"</p>

<p>"That was undertaken two and a half years ago; at
that time she was in a delicate state of health, and the
physicians recommended a tour around the Adriatic.
She travelled incognito with a slender suite under the
care of Cardinal Ravenna."</p>

<p>"Who took her, among other places," thought Paul,
"to Castel Nuovo, as is proved by the fragment of lace
in the secret corridor."</p>

<p>"This tour was productive of singular results," continued
Trevisa, musingly.</p>

<p>"In what way?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it was to have lasted three months, but it was
extended to six; and when the princess returned she
was an altered being; I do not mean in appearance, I
refer to her character."</p>

<p>Light began to dawn upon Paul. The Princess Natalie
had not returned to Czernova; instead there had come
her living image&mdash;Barbara!</p>

<p>"What remarkable development had the princess's
character undergone?"</p>

<p>"Beforetime she was a gay and vivacious maiden.
She returned grave and sedate. This change was attributed
to the earthquake."</p>

<p>"The earthquake?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you remember the great upheaval on
the Dalmatian littoral two years ago?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I remember something of the sort, now I come
to think of it."</p>

<p>"Well, the terrible scenes witnessed by Princess Natalie,
together with her own nearness to death, seem to
have sobered her from girlhood into womanhood. From
that time she began to take a keen interest in state affairs,
which she had previously regarded as boredom."</p>

<p>"Barbara was keenly interested in politics," thought
Paul.</p>

<p>"Beforetime her predilections, if she had any, were
in favor of Russia. She returned divested of her Muscovite
sympathies."</p>

<p>"Barbara was decidedly an anti-Muscovite," thought
Paul.</p>

<p>"But the greatest change&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, the greatest change&mdash;?" repeated Paul, observing
that the other had stopped short in his utterance
with the air of one about to be betrayed into an imprudent
statement.</p>

<p>As Trevisa did not reply, Paul drew a bow at a venture.</p>

<p>"The princess was reared in the Greek faith, I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
given to understand? Humph! what was Prince Thaddeus
thinking of when he placed his daughter under the
tutelage of Cardinal Ravenna? One can guess the result.
The princess went away a Greek, and came back
a Catholic. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" muttered Trevisa, glancing around in some
trepidation. "Yes, that is so. You have hit on a state
secret, communicated only to her cabinet, and to me&mdash;her
secretary. But, Paul, breathe not a word of this
to any one, for the knowledge of it would shake her
throne, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. There was a sudden commotion in the
street below. Pedestrians had stopped in their walk, and
were crowding to the edge of the pavement with their
faces all set in one direction, whence came the distant
sound of cheering and of clapping hands. The applause
rolled in <i>crescendo</i> along the boulevards, advancing
nearer each moment to the two friends.</p>

<p>"Here comes the princess!" cried Trevisa, springing
to his feet. Paul felt his heart beating as it had never
beat before when he turned his eyes towards the approaching
cavalcade.</p>

<p>First came a detachment of Polish uhlans, their burnished
lances glittering in the morning sunshine, and the
points decorated with black pennons that fluttered in the
breeze.</p>

<p>The handsome regimentals of this <i>corps du garde</i>, the
Blue Legion, promptly drew from Paul the remark,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, their uniform is the same as the Twenty-fourth
Kentish!"</p>

<p>"A remark previously made by me," observed Trevisa,
drily. "You are singularly forgetful, Paul."</p>

<p>On came the lancers at a swinging trot, followed by an
open landau containing the princess.</p>

<p>A moment more and this carriage was abreast of the
hotel, and as if fortune were favoring Paul, the vehicle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
was brought to a sudden stand-still opposite the balcony
on which he stood.</p>

<p>The equipage was a dainty one, lined with pale blue
silk, the arms of Poland gleaming in gold from the polished
sable panel. The fine black horses, with coats like
shining satin, were decked in silver harness.</p>

<p>But Paul saw nothing of this equipage; his eyes were
set upon its occupant.</p>

<p>There, seated in graceful state, with silken sunshade
poised above her head, and responsive to the plaudits of
the people by sweet smiles and a courteous bending of
her head, was&mdash;the youthful and beautiful Barbara!</p>

<p>The supreme joy of realizing that she was actually living
so affected Paul that for a moment the whole street&mdash;Barbara,
soldiers, people, buildings&mdash;became a confused
swimming vision. A sound like the murmur of
many waters filled his ears.</p>

<p>With difficulty he controlled his first impulse to descend
the hotel steps, crying "Barbara! Barbara!" It
set his teeth on edge afterwards when he recalled how
near he had come to making a fool of himself. No, his
first interview with her must not take place in the open
street before a wondering, gaping throng.</p>

<p>Fearing lest she should glance upwards and recognize
him, Paul drew aside behind a screen of aloes that decorated
the balcony, and continued to watch.</p>

<p>Yes, it was truly Barbara. The convent-fugitive who
had strolled with him through the pine-woods of Dalmatia,
the Polish maiden whom he had held in his arms
had become a real princess with a court, ministers, and
an army at her command. The wonderment of it all!
And though she had spent nearly a third of her life in a
convent, yet there she sat with the air of one born in the
purple. It was amazing, nay, charming, to mark the
dignity and the ease with which she carried herself in
her new state.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>The landau of the princess had been stopped before the
Hôtel de Varsovie in order to enable her to address two
pedestrians, who, judging from the respect paid to them
by the crowd, were persons of distinction in the little
world of Czernova.</p>

<p>The first was an elderly, silver-haired man of fine
presence, and distinguished by a stately, old-fashioned
courtesy.</p>

<p>"Count Radzivil," replied Trevisa, in answer to Paul's
question. "The prime minister of Czernova, brother of
the celebrated Michael, who commanded the Polish insurgents
of '30."</p>

<p>As the premier was old enough to be Barbara's grandfather,
Paul could afford to view him with composure;
but the case was very different with the other individual.</p>

<p>He was a man of lofty stature, and of broad, massive
build, with a dark, handsome face set off with black eyes
and a black beard. The sunbeams toyed with the silver
eagle upon his helmet. His splendid uniform glittered
with gold lace, stars, and orders. He carried himself erect,
his left hand resting upon the hilt of his sabre; and it was
clear that both in his own opinion, and also in the opinion
of the crowd, he was a very grand personage indeed.</p>

<p>"Who's His Serene Tallness?"</p>

<p>"John the Strong, Duke of Bora, commander of the
Czernovese army, a member of the cabinet, and the heir-apparent
to the crown. He is first cousin to the princess,
and likewise a near kinsman of the Czar."</p>

<p>Envy and misgiving stole over Paul as he contrasted
his own inferior rank with that of the imperially-connected
Bora. Barbara was bending forward in her carriage,
laughing pleasantly, and apparently holding an
animated conversation with the duke. One might almost
have thought that she was exerting all her arts to please
him.</p>

<p>Paul surveyed him more attentively, and quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
gauged his character,&mdash;an individual naturally sullen,
of a somewhat slow intellect, yet not without ambition;
a man upon whom the graces and restraints of polite life
lay but lightly; a little provocation, and the savage
would soon be in evidence. What could Barbara find in
this man to interest her?</p>

<p>"Bora seems on excellent terms with the princess,"
said Paul.</p>

<p>"Naturally, seeing that he is to marry her."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Paul's intonation was so sharp that Trevisa turned to
survey him.</p>

<p>"Why, Paul, how white you're grown!"</p>

<p>"Merely a pang from an old wound. But your princess;
she can't entertain any real love for <i>that</i> fellow."</p>

<p>"Love was never fashionable at courts," smiled Trevisa.
His words jarred upon Paul. If Barbara had become
such that she could marry without any love on her
side, then her nature must have sadly changed from what
it was in the old sweet days at Castel Nuovo.</p>

<p>"It is a <i>mariage de convenance</i>," continued Trevisa,
"tending to secure her position on the throne, and&mdash;but
see, she is about to set off again."</p>

<p>The princess, having finished her conversation, drew
off her right glove and extended her fair jewelled hand
to the duke with a smile and graciousness of manner that
roused all the jealousy in Paul's nature.</p>

<p>"She has forgotten me," he murmured bitterly. "Well,
of course, she thinks me dead; but even if she knew
otherwise, it is not likely that she will pay much regard
to me now. And yet what were her words to me on the
day that we were parted? 'If I were an empress, Paul,
I would be your wife.' Humph! we shall see."</p>

<p>Bora raised the delicate hand to his lips amid the applause
of the crowd, who seemed to regard the incident
as a very pretty tableau.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>Count Radzivil lifted his hat with courtly grace, and
the next moment the landau was gliding smoothly along
the Boulevard de Cracovie, followed by a detachment of
cavalry similar in equipments to that which had preceded
it.</p>

<p>Paul was left a victim to perplexing thoughts.</p>

<p>What had become of the real Princess Natalie, and
why had Barbara assumed the name, title, and sceptre of
the daughter of Thaddeus, personating the character with
such art and tact as apparently to defy detection, since
Trevisa, though long resident in Czernova, had no suspicion
of the substitution that had taken place?</p>

<p>Had Barbara a just title to the throne? Recalling her
air as she sat in the landau, Paul felt that he could not
associate the appropriation of another's heritage with that
winsome and dignified presence. No, difficult though it
was to explain her conduct, he would believe anything
rather than that she was a conscious and willing usurper.

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER II<br /><br />
CZERNOVESE POLITICS</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>
<p>"Well," said Trevisa, puzzled by Paul's long
silence, "what think you of this fair vestal
throned in the east?"</p>

<p>"My wonder is how you, her private secretary, compelled
by your office to attend her daily, have avoided
falling in love with her."</p>

<p>"By steeling my heart and playing the philosopher.
Princesses are not for common mortals like myself. Give
me blue blood and a title, and I might aspire. The sovereign
of Czernova must not marry a commoner, on pain
of forfeiture of the crown. Her consort must be one of
royal or noble birth."</p>

<p>"Ah! is that the law?" asked Paul, with affected
carelessness.</p>

<p>"So runneth the statute of Czernova," replied the
secretary.</p>

<p>"<i>The sovereign must not marry a commoner!</i>" Why
had he come to Czernova? Better to have remained in
ignorance of her fate, than, on finding her, to learn that
she could never be his.</p>

<p>"You said," he remarked, after an interval of silence,
"that the marriage of the princess with the duke will
secure the stability of her throne. In what way?"</p>

<p>"The explanation will require a long lecture on Czernovese
politics. You will esteem me a bore."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Go on."</p>

<p>"To begin then. This principality of Czernova represents
the last fragment of the ancient kingdom of Poland;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
it is one of the old palatinates, and the Lilieskis were its
palatines.</p>

<p>"On the fall of Poland, in 1795, Czernova formed part
of the share allotted to Russia, and received exceptional
treatment from that power, the reason being that the
Lilieski of that day, a handsome young fellow, was one
of the favorites of the Empress Catherine. She not only
permitted him to retain his palatinate, but even created
him Prince, and set her hand and seal to a new constitution
framed by Lilieski himself, which conferred upon
Czernova all the rights of a free and independent state.
The Russians of to-day aver that the Empress must have
signed the document without reading it, or at least without
understanding what she was granting. Be that as it
may, the Poles of Czernova, having obtained a Charter of
Liberty, have resolutely refused to assent to any modification
of its provisions."</p>

<p>"But seeing that Russia is a hundred times the
stronger, what has prevented her from annexing Czernova?"</p>

<p>"The rescript of the Congress of Vienna to the effect
that 'Czernova shall be governed according to the Charter
granted by Catherine II.' The Powers are therefore
pledged to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.</p>

<p>"So much for the political frame-work. Now for the
people.</p>

<p>"The Czernovese consist of diverse elements, but the
two chief nationalities are Poles and Muscovites.</p>

<p>"The Poles are the original inhabitants of the country,
passionately attached to their liberty, and Catholics to a
man. They form a majority in the principality; but for
the two past decades there has been a steady influx of
immigrants from Russia, which, if continued in the same
ratio, will inevitably result in the Russification of
Czernova.</p>

<p>"These Muscovites, it need scarcely be said, belong to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
the Greek Church, the head of which is the Czar; their
sympathies are of course pro-Russian, and if the Emperor
Nicholas were to prepare to-morrow for annexation
very few of them would lift a finger to prevent it.</p>

<p>"Here, then, is the crux of the political situation.</p>

<p>"Czernova is occupied by two races alien in blood,
language, religion and ideals. They can no more unite
than fire with water. In the Diet, Poles and Muscovites
form two hostile factions; the debates are acrimonious;
swords are sometimes drawn, and the scenes occurring
lack none of the fiery picturesqueness that was wont to
characterize the old Polish Diet of Warsaw."</p>

<p>"A difficult matter," interjected Paul, "to find a ruler
who shall be acceptable to both factions."</p>

<p>"Well, as things are at present," replied Trevisa,
emphasizing the last two words, "the Princess Natalie
satisfies the requirement. The Poles love her for her
nationality; and the Muscovites, if they do not love, are
at least disposed to tolerate a ruler whom they believe to
be a member of their own Church. It is a guarantee that
their own creed will not be persecuted, for you know how
intolerantly the Roman Church behaved in old Poland.</p>

<p>"Now it is the princess's secret faith which constitutes
the coming peril.</p>

<p>"When the Muscovites learn that she is a Catholic&mdash;and
the truth cannot remain much longer hidden&mdash;it is
doubtful whether their loyalty will be able to stand the
shock. They may rise in arms and endeavor to seat the
Duke of Bora on the throne, who has three recommendations
in their eyes; he is of the Greek Church, a Muscovite
on the mother's side, and connected, as I have said,
with the blood-imperial of Russia.</p>

<p>"Hence, in the opinion of the cabinet, the necessity for
the marriage of the princess with the duke; their joint
occupation of the throne is the only thing that can keep
Pole and Muscovite from cutting each other's throats. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
son born of this marriage will tend to unite the interests
of both parties."</p>

<p>Barbara with a son! And by the duke! The thought
set Paul's blood on fire.</p>

<p>"The cabinet of course are united on the question of
this marriage?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They mayn't like it, but, as I have said, they feel its
necessity. I can name two ministers, however, who, outwardly
assenting, are secretly opposing the match."</p>

<p>"And they are&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Cardinal Ravenna and Marshal Zabern."</p>

<p>Ravenna! It was rather surprising to find Barbara
including among her ministry the ecclesiastic who had
formerly inspired her with aversion. Then Paul's surprise
ceased when he reflected that the cardinal was master
of her secret history, and would therefore require to
be conciliated. An uneasy suspicion began to form in
his mind that Barbara was the innocent victim of a Jesuitical
conspiracy&mdash;that she had been duped into believing
herself a princess by ecclesiastics who intended to make
use of her as a tool.</p>

<p>"A Latin cardinal," he said. "I can understand that
he would oppose the marrying of the princess to a Greek
heretic. But Zabern&mdash;who is he?"</p>

<p>Trevisa smiled.</p>

<p>"You will not be long in Czernova without learning
who Zabern is. He is the Warden of the Charter, the
most subtle character in the cabinet, the idol of the Czernovese
Poles, whose motto is 'Trust in God and Zabern&mdash;especially
Zabern.' Ask the Muscovites who Zabern is,
and they will blaspheme and tell you that he is the incarnation
of the devil. And as the slaying of the devil would
be a holy act, their pious attentions in this respect have
compelled the marshal to go about with chain-mail beneath
his clothing."</p>

<p>"And Zabern, you say, is opposed to the match? But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
if the princess has set her mind upon it, how does Zabern
propose to play his game?"</p>

<p>"His first card is the Pope."</p>

<p>"The Pope?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The princess, being a Catholic, is debarred by
the canons of her Church from marrying the duke, inasmuch
as he is her first cousin. The papal dispensation is
necessary before the union can be celebrated."</p>

<p>"And should the Holy Father refuse to grant it?"</p>

<p>Trevisa's face assumed a very grave expression.</p>

<p>"Then the princess will indeed be in a dilemma. If
she marries without papal sanction the union will be
deemed null and void by her Catholic subjects. All the
Polish clergy will be set against her, and you know what
that means. On the other hand, if she submits to the will
of the Pope, and dismisses her ducal suitor, she will put
herself in grave peril. The coronation takes place within
four months from now, and the Muscovites are fully expecting
to see the duke seated side by side with her in that
ceremony. Disappointment will cause an armed rising
on their part, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;I greatly fear there
will be an end to the princess's rule."</p>

<p>"How so? Why should not her adherents prevail?"</p>

<p>"They would, if left to themselves, for they are the
more numerous party. But, behind the Muscovite faction,
and filling the minds of the ministers with secret fear,
looms the colossal shadow of the Czar. If there should
be riots, and the Poles should take to burning and killing,
the Muscovites will cry to Nicholas to protect his own
kith and kin, and then, good-bye to Czernovese liberty.
The Czar will have what he has so long sought&mdash;a pretext
for annexation. Heaven avert such a calamity, but
one cannot prophesy a bright future for Czernova unless
this marriage takes place."</p>

<p>Trevisa had scarcely finished this exposition of Czernovese
politics when he happened to see a lady well known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
to him entering the hotel. Asking Paul to excuse his
absence for a few minutes, he went off to pay his devoirs.</p>

<p>Paul, not unwilling to be left alone, sat thinking of
Barbara. What would be the state of her feelings when
she learned that he was alive? She had accepted his love
prior to the knowledge of her high rank. It was not likely
that under her changed circumstances she would consider
herself bound by her past promises. Granting, however,
that she still loved him; granting that the Duke of Bora
would be so heroic as to efface himself, marriage was impossible
without the forfeiture of that sceptre, which
rightfully or wrongfully she now held, and to this sacrifice
Paul felt that he could never consent, even if Barbara
herself were willing.</p>

<p>His duty was clear. He must live his life apart from
her. But before he left Czernova he must have an interview
with her. He must see her once more face to face
and alone, and he thought of this meeting with feelings
of pleasure and pain.</p>

<p>Looking up from this reverie, whom should he see at
a little distance but the Duke of Bora, attended by Count
Radzivil. The pair were making their way along the
balcony of the hotel, apparently with the intention of
taking a seat or calling for wine at one of the many little
tables spread about.</p>

<p>As the duke drew near, a spirit of latent defiance took
possession of Paul. This was the man destined to rob
him of Barbara&mdash;Barbara who belonged of prior right
to himself. It was clearly state-policy that dictated her
attitude towards the duke. Paul found it impossible to
believe that the delicately-minded and intellectual Barbara
could feel any genuine love for this great, clumsy barbarian.</p>

<p>"Let him keep to Natalie, and leave me Barbara. What
sort of a lover must he be? Where were his eyes two years
ago, that he did not perceive that the returning princess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
was not his first love? Barbara must have played her
part well so to impose upon him. But was he deceived?
Does he know the truth, and knowing, make use of it
to intimidate Barbara into marrying him?"</p>

<p>A thought which did not tend to increase Paul's
amiability.</p>

<p>As the duke passed he eyed Paul askance, and then
wheeling round with a suddenness that formed a marked
contrast with his previous slowness, he exclaimed in a
voice of thunder,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have neither stood nor saluted, sir!"</p>

<p>Paul regarded the fierce Bora with a look of calm
surprise. What right had this Czernovese grandee to
demand a salute from him&mdash;an English officer?</p>

<p>"You have neither stood nor saluted, sir!"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>The duke's black eyes flashed savagely; his face grew
as dark as night.</p>

<p>"Are you mad or drunk? Report yourself a prisoner
at the Citadel."</p>

<p>"Again I ask, why should I?"</p>

<p>Bora gripped his sword-handle with an air compounded
of amazement and fury. A whispered word from Radzivil
seemed to exercise a moderating effect upon him.</p>

<p>"Permit me to give my name," said the minister, stepping
forward with a courteous bearing. "I am Count
Radzivil, premier of Czernova. May I ask a like favor?"</p>

<p>"I am an Englishman, Captain Woodville of the 24th
Kentish. May I ask who is this&mdash;ah!&mdash;gentleman?"</p>

<p>An Englishman! Bora immediately recognized his
error. Misled by Paul's uniform he had taken him for
one of his own officers. The duke could ill bear ridicule,
and if this story got abroad he would be the laughingstock
of Czernova.</p>

<p>"Permit me to reveal my dignity," he began stiffly.</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;? But proceed, sir."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>"I am the Duke of Bora, commander-in-chief of the
Czernovese army. Your English uniform being so similar
to the Czernovese&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me. You mean that the Czernovese is so
similar to the English."</p>

<p>"That I not unreasonably took you for a Czernovese
officer."</p>

<p>And with a scowl the duke drew aside, deeming that
he made a sufficient apology, and Paul, had he chosen,
might have boasted that he was the only man who had
ever drawn an apology from the duke.</p>

<p>"Woodville? Woodville?" murmured the premier
with a musing air. "Surely not the Captain Woodville
who conducted the defence of the Afghan fortress of
Tajapore?"</p>

<p>"The same," replied Paul modestly.</p>

<p>The duke glanced askance at Paul with a feeling of
jealousy, the mean jealousy of the man who had done
Nothing, against the man who had done Something.</p>

<p>Paul's breast was without a single decoration. The
duke's breast was a glitter of stars and crosses, none of
which had been gained by actual service in war. Bora
felt the irony of the contrast, and grew more bitter. Radzivil,
however, was full of genuine affability.</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville, it gives me great pleasure to meet
you," he said, extending his hand. "Had we known of
your intention to visit Czernova you should have been
met with a guard of honor, and received in a manner
worthy of your fame. It was wrong of you to slip privately
into Slavowitz. Englishmen are always welcome
at the court of the princess. The princess, sir, takes a
great interest in English affairs, so much so that some of
our free-speaking newspapers (for as you are perhaps
aware, we have no censorship of the press in Czernova)
have ventured to term her an Anglomaniac; Anglophile
would be a more suitable term. At her initiative we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
modelled the forms of our Diet upon the lines of your
House of Commons. For example, we give three readings
to a Bill. The princess has a great admiration for
the English. You may not know that she has an Englishman
for her private secretary."</p>

<p>"You allude to Trevisa. My friend, count. We
studied together at the same university."</p>

<p>"Really now, this is a very interesting coincidence,"
said Radzivil, tapping his snuff-box pleasantly. "Your
grace," he added, turning to the duke, "Captain Woodville
is an old friend of Trevisa's."</p>

<p>But Bora affected not to hear. He hated the secretary,
and as a corollary, all who were the friends of the
secretary.</p>

<p>"Trevisa is an admirable acquisition," continued the
premier, "and has done us good service in many ways.
Your grace remembers that important cipher despatch
which fell into our hands some time ago. It baffled the
experts. But Trevisa succeeded in unravelling it. He is
the author of a work on cryptography, I believe, though
I am ashamed to say I haven't yet read it. The princess
has no more loyal servant than Trevisa. He is more
Czernovese than the Czernovese themselves, and will
take a pride in describing to you the resources of our
little state. We may not count for much among the
Great Powers, but we are a good deal stronger than most
people suppose."</p>

<p>"'<i>Esse quam videri</i>,'" smiled Paul.</p>

<p>"Your grace, Captain Woodville honors you. He is
quoting the motto of the ducal House of Bora."</p>

<p>Now this little Latin sentence was the same as that
inscribed on the golden band of the seal which Paul had
found in the secret corridor of Castel Nuovo.</p>

<p>He happened at that moment to be wearing the signet
affixed to his watch-chain, and scarcely knowing that he
did so, he drew it forth and looked at it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>The duke, attentive to Paul's action, caught sight of the
sparkling sapphire. He started, took a step forward&mdash;another&mdash;a
third&mdash;his eyes all the time resting upon
the gem.</p>

<p>"How came you possessed of that seal?"</p>

<p>There was something so peculiarly aggressive in the
duke's manner that an angry retort trembled on Paul's
lips.</p>

<p>"Did you not receive it from a lady?"</p>

<p>Then the truth flashed upon Paul. This signet must
have belonged to the duke, inasmuch as it bore his motto.
An historic heirloom, it had been given by him to the
Princess Natalie, and had been lost by her in the secret
passage where Paul had found it. No wonder that Bora
was incensed at its re-appearance in this fashion! Jealousy
caused him to draw an altogether erroneous conclusion,
and unfortunately it was impossible for Paul
to set him right without entering into the particulars of
his sojourn at Castel Nuovo.</p>

<p>"A lady gave you that ring."</p>

<p>"There your grace errs."</p>

<p>"That's a lie," cried Bora savagely.</p>

<p>"Softly, your grace," remonstrated Radzivil, glancing
nervously around. "Let us have no scandal in public."
With difficulty Paul restrained his anger.</p>

<p>"Your grace's language is extremely offensive, but I
am willing to make all allowances. I do not wish to quarrel
with you. This seal was not given to me by a lady.
I found it, and you claim it as yours. I am quite willing
to restore it."</p>

<p>Bora took Paul's self-restraint for cowardice.</p>

<p>"You found it? Where? When? Under what circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Those are questions that I must decline to answer."</p>

<p>"You refuse?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you shall fight me."</p>

<p>Paul, thoroughly roused by the duke's arrogant manner,
was not at all averse to accepting this challenge.</p>

<p>Then he thought of Barbara. The affair could not be
hidden. She would learn that his first act on coming into
Czernova was to fight a duel with her future consort. He
would thus appear in her eyes as a brawling swashbuckler
presuming on her affection to protect him from the consequences
of his acts.</p>

<p>"No, your grace, I shall not fight," he replied quietly.</p>

<p>"Finding it easier to meet Afghans than a Czernovese,"
sneered Bora. "Have you ever noticed, Radzivil, how
brave these English are against all the savage races of the
world,&mdash;how reluctant to face the European? If you
will not fight I cannot, of course, compel you. But I can
at least brand you as a coward."</p>

<p>And lifting the cane that he carried he brought it down
heavily across Paul's cheek.</p>

<p>"Your grace!" exclaimed Radzivil, and filled with disgust
and anger he walked away to the far end of the
balcony.</p>

<p>The bronze had faded from Paul's face leaving it
deadly white save for a livid stripe on the left cheek.</p>

<p>"Will you fight me now?" said the duke with a sneering
smile and raising his cane again, "or does your cowardice
require a further stimulus?"</p>

<p>"Fight you? Yes, by heaven!" said Paul, with a deep
inspiration. "Send your second here without delay to
meet mine. I hold no further parley with you. My
sword shall speak for me."</p>

<p>A gleam of ferocious joy passed over the duke's face.</p>

<p>"My second shall attend yours within an hour. But
first a caution to Radzivil. He hath too talkative a
tongue, and this matter must be kept secret."</p>

<p>He turned from Paul, who sat down, the cynosure of
many eyes. The loungers on the balcony, the hotel-attendants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the passers-by on the boulevard, had seen the
duke's action, and concluded that in his usual sweet
fashion he was simply chastising the impertinence of one
of his own subordinates.</p>

<p>And as Paul sat there thinking, first of the insult he
had received, and then of the fair, graceful head of Barbara
pillowed on the breast of this savage, he felt the
devil of hatred rising within him.</p>

<p>"By God, I'll kill him!" he muttered between his set
teeth. "I shall be doing Barbara a service. He to marry
her, forsooth!"</p>

<p>The Duke of Bora, not at all ashamed of his display of
passion, vexed only that Radzivil should have shown such
marked disapproval, moved forward to the table where
the premier sat with wine before him.</p>

<p>The latter durst offer no more than mild remonstrances,
for he occupied a delicate position. It was not polite to
make an enemy of one destined to be the Prince Consort
of Czernova.</p>

<p>"Your grace, you forget that duelling is forbidden by
the law."</p>

<p>"I am the heir-apparent, and above the law," returned
Bora haughtily.</p>

<p>"You will not find the princess taking that view of the
matter. Remember how earnest she was in advocating
the Anti-duelling Act. For one of her own ministers to
fly in the face of it is to treat her with contempt. Your
grace is acting very unwisely&mdash;acting in a manner, pardon
me for saying it, that may lead to the forfeiture of
her hand."</p>

<p>"Bah! my good Radzivil, be but discreet and she
will never hear of it. Remember," he added with a
menacing air, "if her Highness becomes cognizant of this
affair I shall know who was her informant."</p>

<p>He tossed off a glass of wine, and shot a ferocious
glance in Paul's direction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>"Who could avoid blazing forth?" he presently remarked.
"Do you know, Radzivil, that that sapphire seal
was a gift of mine to Natalie? Whenever I have had occasion
to refer to it she has looked embarrassed&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Probably because she lost it, and has not liked to say
so; and inasmuch as it is now in the Englishman's hands
it is evident that he must have found it."</p>

<p>"The finding of the seal would be a very innocent
matter; why, then, does he refuse to state the circumstances?"</p>

<p>Radzivil did not reply, as he might very well have replied,
that the mildest-natured individual would have
taken umbrage at the duke's insolent manner. He merely
remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What would your grace infer?"</p>

<p>"That the seal was given to yon fellow by Natalie
herself."</p>

<p>"Your grace must be mistaken. This is Captain Woodville's
first visit to Czernova. When and where could
the princess have seen him?"</p>

<p>"Where? Why not in Dalmatia? Ah! light at last,"
muttered Bora, grinding his teeth and gripping his sabre-hilt
with a murderous look towards the distant Paul.</p>

<p>"Your grace, explain."</p>

<p>"Why did Natalie extend her stay in Dalmatia from
three to six months? There is the cause," he added,
indicating Paul.</p>

<p>"A secret amour with him at a time when she was
affianced to you! You wrong the princess," said Radzivil
coldly.</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed the duke, excitement gleaming
from his eyes. "Why did she return so melancholy in
mood that I almost doubted whether she were the lively
Natalie of former days? There is the cause!" he added,
again indicating Paul.</p>

<p>"Your grace, this is midsummer madness."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"Before that ill-starred tour she was ever ready to
marry me; now, she continually defers our nuptials.
Why? There is the cause!" with the same gesture as
before. "She clothes her <i>corps du garde</i> in a new uniform.
Why? To do honor to her hero&mdash;her lover."</p>

<p>"Her lover?" dissented Radzivil. "And yet she has
kept him at a distance for two years?"</p>

<p>"She knows that my sword is sharp, and that I brook
no rivals. Who aspires to the princess answers to me.
Ha! her desire for an Anti-duelling Act is now explained.
The measure is to enable her lover to walk securely in
Czernova. She would protect him from my sword. She
thinks he may safely venture here now. She has doubtless
been corresponding with him since her return from
Dalmatia, their common friend, Trevisa, acting as intermediary,
being well qualified for such office. To
an affianced princess engaged in a clandestine <i>affaire
du c&oelig;ur</i>, an adept at cipher-writing is a very useful
auxiliary."</p>

<p>He again glared in Paul's direction with such ferocity
of countenance that the premier, thinking that he was
about to jump up for the purpose of making an onslaught
upon Paul, tried to divert the duke's thoughts by turning
to another topic, and accordingly snatched at the word
"cipher."</p>

<p>"Trevisa, as you say, is an adept at cipher-writing, but
at present his knowledge is somewhat at fault."</p>

<p>"To what do you allude?"</p>

<p>"To a cryptographic problem recently set him by
Zabern. Four weeks ago a tavern-brawl between some
Poles and Muscovites rose so high as to call for the intervention
of the night watch, who marched the offenders to
the guard-house. The customary search taking place,
there was found upon one of the men a Russian passport
made out to one Ivan Russakoff, which name the man
declared to be his."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>Radzivil had succeeded admirably in diverting the
duke's attention. Anger faded from his face. Paul and
the duel seemed to be forgotten in a new interest.</p>

<p>"This Russakoff wore a caftan, in the lining of which
was concealed a large sheet of paper folded twice, and
covered on both sides, not with words but with rows of
numerals.</p>

<p>"In the morning the offenders were released with the
exception of Russakoff, who was asked to explain the
meaning of the paper. But this he refused to do. He
averred that he was an agent travelling for a cloth merchant
of Warsaw named Pascovitch; and, as a matter of
fact, he carried a portfolio containing specimens of cloth.
Inquiries show that there is a cloth merchant of that name
at Warsaw, that Russakoff is his agent, and that the
tailoring establishments of Slavowitz have considerable
dealings with this Pascovitch."</p>

<p>"They let the fellow go after that, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Not so. The matter came to Zabern's ears, and he
had the man brought before him.</p>

<p>"'What do these numerals mean?' Zabern asked.</p>

<p>"'They are the secrets of my business,' answered
Russakoff.</p>

<p>"'Without doubt,' said the marshal. 'Your business is
that of a spy. Your cloth-selling is a mere cloak to conceal
your real calling.' Zabern kept him under examination
for a long time. Russakoff refused to give the
meaning of the mysterious paper; he failed to account
for certain portions of his time spent at Slavowitz; and
the marshal, convinced that the fellow is a spy in the service
of Russia, has removed him for greater security to
the Citadel where he now is. The paper has been entrusted
to Trevisa for decipherment, and there the matter
rests for the present."</p>

<p>"And you say the cipher puzzles Trevisa?"</p>

<p>"He can make no headway with it at all."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>The duke seemed rather pleased than otherwise at
Trevisa's failure.</p>

<p>"Zabern sees a spy in every man who comes from
Russia," he sneered.</p>

<p>"Well, we shall soon know the truth. Zabern talks of
employing the rack and the thumbscrew to-day."</p>

<p>"That's illegal," said the duke with a frown.</p>

<p>"So's duelling," retorted the premier.</p>

<p>Bora seemed on the point of making an angry reply, but
checked himself and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And this supposed spy was arrested a month ago, you
say? If Zabern deems this a matter of such importance,
why was not I, a minister, informed of it?"</p>

<p>"The affair falls within Zabern's department, as he is
the Minister for Justice. I myself did not hear of it till
yesterday, and then it was by accident. And," added the
premier, weakly smiling at the acknowledgment that he
was not master in his own cabinet, "you know Zabern's
way of acting without the knowledge of his colleagues,
and the princess's reply to our plaint 'Zabern is
privileged.'"</p>

<p>None knew this better than the duke himself, and there
passed over his face a dark look, which implied that
when he should come to occupy a moiety of the throne
there would be a considerable curtailment of Zabern's
privileges.</p>

<p>Tossing off the remainder of his wine at one gulp, the
duke rose to go, accompanied by Radzivil.</p>

<p>After their departure Paul observed a little book lying
on the floor of the balcony near the table where the two
men had been sitting, and concluded that it had been unknowingly
dropped by one of them. While he was wondering
whether to let it lie, or to send it after them by a
waiter, Noel Trevisa made his appearance, his long
absence suggesting that he had had a very interesting
time with his fair lady friend.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>He noticed the book and, moved by curiosity, picked it
up and found it to be a pocket-edition of the poet Æschylus
containing the Greek text of the seven plays
without translation, note or comment.</p>

<p>While casually turning over the leaves Trevisa suddenly
stopped and knitted his brows in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Now who has put himself to all this trouble, and what
is the object of it?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"My book, Sir Secretary."</p>

<p>Looking up Trevisa caught the keen black eyes of the
duke fixed suspiciously upon him.</p>

<p>"I still keep up my knowledge of the classics, you perceive,"
remarked Bora, as the book was returned to him.</p>

<p>"You study them very attentively, too, I observe," said
the secretary; "it isn't every student that takes to counting
the exact number of words in a Greek play."</p>

<p>Bora stared hard at Trevisa as if detecting a hidden
meaning in his reply, and then turned away, obviously ill
at ease.</p>

<p>Trevisa rejoined Paul, and catching sight of the red
line on his friend's cheek he instantly inquired the cause.</p>

<p>"The signature of John the Strong," replied Paul,
grimly, proceeding to explain.</p>

<p>In describing the recent fracas Paul, not wishing to
refer to Castel Nuovo, suppressed the incident of the seal,
making it appear that his non-salute of the duke was the
cause of the quarrel.</p>

<p>Trevisa listened with a look of the utmost consternation.</p>

<p>"The damned savage!" he muttered. "Paul, you are
rushing to certain death. The duke is mighty with the
sabre. There is not his equal in all Czernova."</p>

<p>"Small praise, seeing that Czernova is but small."</p>

<p>"He has already fought thirty duels, seven of which
ended fatally for his opponent."</p>

<p>"He won't fight more than his thirty-first. And, Noel,
you must be my second."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"Dare I? The princess is sternly opposed to duelling.
Under the late Prince Thaddeus it was frightfully prevalent;
Poles and Muscovites were for ever challenging and
fighting each other. After her accession Zabern carried
a bill making the duels a penal offence."</p>

<p>"And yet the duke, though aware of this, gives a
challenge! Humph! law-maker, law-breaker! And what
are the penalties for infringing the law?"</p>

<p>"Imprisonment for principals and seconds alike. If
one should fall the survivor is to be put on his trial for
murder. You are between the devil and the deep sea,
Paul. If the duke should win, you die; if you should win,
you die all the same at the hands of the Czernovese law,
unless you take to immediate flight."</p>

<p>What a picture was suggested by these last words!
The duke lying dead, Barbara in mourning, and himself
red-handed, flying from justice! And yet there seemed
no way out of the affair consistent with a soldier's honor.</p>

<p>"Listen, Paul, I have the ear of the princess. A word
from me as to what is about to happen, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would you have the duke point at me as the craven
who shirked a fight by creeping behind the skirts of the
princess, and begging for protection? Anything but that!
But Noel, you must not lose the favor of the princess on
my account. Let me find some other second."</p>

<p>"No, Paul, I were no true friend, if I did not stand by
you in this affair. Here comes Baron Ostrova, the
duke's secretary, and presumably his second, since he has
usually acted as such in Bora's <i>affaires d'honneur</i>. What
instructions, Paul?"</p>

<p>"This evening. At six. Sabres. To the death."</p>

<p>And Paul went on smoking as quietly as if a duel were
an everyday event with him.
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER III<br /><br />
A MENACE FROM THE CZAR</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>
<p>In an ante-chamber of the Vistula Palace sat Count
Radzivil, premier of Czernova, in company with
Marshal Zabern, the Warden of the Charter; and
the Charter being the palladium of Czernovese liberty,
the custody of that sacred document carried with it a
high distinction, second only to that of the premiership.</p>

<p>The two ministers were waiting to communicate to
the princess the contents of an important despatch, which
had just arrived from the Czernovese ambassador at St.
Petersburg; for Czernova, be it known, though but a
small state, was nevertheless sufficiently wealthy to maintain
an embassy at the three courts with which its interests
came most in contact, namely, St. Petersburg,
Vienna, and Berlin.</p>

<p>The only other occupants of the apartment were two
silent chamberlains, standing like statues before the folding
doors of the audience-chamber, each dressed in white
pantaloons and silk stockings, and each decorated with
the silk wand of office.</p>

<p>Ladislas Zabern was a man of fine soldierly presence,
with limbs that seemed carved from oak and soldered
with iron. Courage was indelibly stamped upon his face.
He was fifty-three years of age, and though his dark hair
and moustaches were streaked with gray, he had lost none
of the energy of youth.</p>

<p>A sabre-cut marked his left cheek, for he had known
fighting from early days. There was a legend current
among his admirers&mdash;and they numbered every man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
with Polish blood in his veins&mdash;that in childhood he had
been taken by his father, a patriotic noble, to the sacramental
altar, and made to swear that he would be the
life-long enemy of Russia.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, his fiery youth had been spent in
vain attempts to procure the emancipation of Poland
from the Russian yoke, and, as a result, he had made
acquaintance with that indispensable adjunct to Muscovite
civilization, Siberia. Chains and hardships, however,
had not soured his nature, as the good-humored
twinkle in his eye sufficiently proved.</p>

<p>He was the sword and buckler of Czernova, unceasingly
vigilant in guarding this last fragment of Poland
both against open aggression from without, and also
against secret disaffection from within.</p>

<p>The Muscovites of the principality who regarded him
as an incarnation of the devil had some shadow of reason
on their side; for though Zabern was naturally of a
frank and open disposition, the web of political circumstances
had forced him to be crafty and subtle.</p>

<p>Czernova, being but a small state, was dependent for
its freedom, not upon strength of arms but upon the arts
of diplomacy, and in those arts Zabern was without a
rival. Prince Metternich and Count Nesselrode came off
second-best when they played their game with the Polish
patriot.</p>

<p>No man ever wore the mantle of Ananias with more
ease and grace, and when rebuked half-playfully, half-seriously
by the princess for some brilliant piece of deception,
calculated to make the most daring diplomatist
stand aghast, he would merely reply: "The truth is,
your Highness, each of us was trying to deceive the
other; I happened to be the greater liar of the two, and
so I succeeded. With two empires like Austria and
Russia pressing upon our borders and endeavoring to
annex us, it would be folly to act on the lines of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Sermon on the Mount. We'll wait till they set us the
example."</p>

<p>It was only natural that, as a refugee from Siberia, he
should be an object of hatred to the bureaucracy of St.
Petersburg, and extradition having failed to secure his
person, recourse was had to darker methods, and Zabern
had come to regard attempts upon his life as all in the
day's work.</p>

<p>Such was Marshal Zabern, the leading member of the
Czernovese ministry, for Radzivil's premiership was
purely nominal. None knew better than the count himself
that he had been selected by the princess mainly to
gild the cabinet with a famous historic name.</p>

<p>Radzivil had been narrating to the marshal the incident
of the fracas between Paul and the Duke of
Bora.</p>

<p>To the premier's surprise Zabern received the news
with an air of grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Why, count, this is manna from heaven. Have you
told the others?" he added, meaning by that expression
the rest of the ministry.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the opinion of one and all is that the princess
must be called upon to intervene."</p>

<p>Zabern smiled with the air of one who should say, "A
parcel of old women!"</p>

<p>"Count," he said, assuming an authoritative manner,
"this duel must take place. The good of the state requires
it."</p>

<p>"The cabinet connive at the breaking of the law! Impossible!
It is our duty to inform her Highness without
delay, unless," added the premier, "unless you can give
good reason for acting otherwise."</p>

<p>"Well, I, Zabern, forbid you," laughed the marshal
good-humoredly. "Won't that reason suffice you,
count?"</p>

<p>Ere the premier could reply, the chiming of a silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
bell in the audience-chamber announced that the princess
was ready to receive her visitors.</p>

<p>The chamberlains flung wide the open doors.</p>

<p>"Remember," said Zabern, in a somewhat stern whisper,
"not a word of this duel to the princess."</p>

<p>And the perplexed Radzivil, always guided by the advice
of his colleague, gave a reluctant assent.</p>

<p>The two ministers entered the White Saloon,&mdash;a hall
so called from its pure white decorations relieved with
gold.</p>

<p>At a table sat the fair princess who now bore the name
of Natalie, but in earlier days that of Barbara.</p>

<p>She looked up with a bright smile, and motioned the
two councillors to a seat at her table.</p>

<p>Zabern was her favorite minister, and he on his part
was ready to sacrifice his life to advance her interests and
happiness. It was this sentiment which made him look
askance at her intended marriage with the duke. With
doubts of its wisdom even as a political expedient, he had
no doubts at all as to the private unhappiness that would
result from the union of such an ill-assorted pair.</p>

<p>Therefore, he, Zabern, would prevent it; and matters
that day seemed to be favoring his design.</p>

<p>"You come at an unusual hour, my lords, presumably,
therefore, with important tidings?"</p>

<p>"From the grand liberticide," remarked Zabern.</p>

<p>"Our representative at St. Petersburg," remarked the
premier, taking some papers from his despatch-box, "reports
that at an ambassadorial ball given at the Winter
Palace a few nights ago the Emperor Nicholas walked
up to him, and in a severe voice, obviously intended to
be heard by the whole assembly, exclaimed: 'Is it true,
sir, that the Princess of Czernova has become a convert to
the Catholic Faith?'"</p>

<p>"So my secret has transpired at last!" smiled Barbara.
"Well, it matters little. It would have become public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
knowledge soon, inasmuch as my coronation must take
place in a Latin cathedral."</p>

<p>"Of course the reply of our representative was that
he could give no answer till he had received instructions
from the princess."</p>

<p>"What said the Czar to this?"</p>

<p>"'We,'" replied Radzivil, reading from the despatch,
"'we shall send an envoy to remind the princess that
her coronation-oath requires assent to the Greek Faith.'
Your Highness, the Czar speaks truly. Czernova must
be governed according to its Charter, and as the Charter
fixes the words of the coronation-oath, we cannot deviate
from them without violating the conditions upon which
autonomy was ceded to us. I would that we could send
word to deny the truth of your conversion. Cannot,"
continued the premier, fixing a wistful look upon the face
of the young princess, "cannot your Highness be persuaded
to return to your early faith?"</p>

<p>"My early faith," murmured Barbara to herself, "has
never changed." And then aloud she added, "Why,
count, would you have me change my faith as lightly as
I change my mantle?"</p>

<p>Zabern, though a Catholic himself, and that mainly because
the Czar was a Greek, was nevertheless a politician
before all things, and he here intervened with a characteristic
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Since your Highness has not yet publicly avowed
yourself a Catholic, you are free to deny that you are
one. Act diplomatically. Publicly attend the services of
the Greek basilica; privately have your own oratory in
the palace here. The Pope will doubtless grant you a dispensation
to this effect."</p>

<p>"No more such counsel, I pray you," said Barbara,
coldly. "I am a Catholic, not a Jesuit."</p>

<p>"Your Highness corrects me with admirable judgment,"
returned Zabern, who made a point of always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
agreeing with his sovereign, for by such course he usually
contrived to secure his own way in the end.</p>

<p>"Our representative proceeds to say," remarked the
premier, referring again to his despatch, "that the Czar's
words and manner were regarded by all the ambassadors
present as a distinct menace to your Highness. 'The annexation
of the principality,' and '<i>Finis Czernovæ</i>' passed
from lip to lip."</p>

<p>"Czernova has survived many similar threats," said
Barbara disdainfully.</p>

<p>"It is the contention of the Czar and his ministers,"
pursued the premier, "that as a Catholic your Highness
is precluded from reigning. We would not alarm your
Highness unnecessarily, but we cannot disguise the fact
that we are approaching a very grave crisis."</p>

<p>"Be it so," replied Barbara, firmly. "My faith is
dearer to me than crown or life. I shall not change it
to please the Czar."</p>

<p>Radzivil looked the picture of melancholy at this
avowal.</p>

<p>"As the Czar has promised to send an envoy," remarked
Zabern, "your Highness will, of course, delay
your answer till his arrival?"</p>

<p>To this Barbara assented.</p>

<p>"And in the interval," smiled Zabern cynically,&mdash;he
was never happier than when opposing Russian designs,&mdash;"we
will set the jurists to work to discover whether
they cannot put upon the coronation-oath an interpretation
different from that taken by the Czar. We will appeal
to the decision of the other Powers; they being interested
in opposing Russian aggrandizement will readily
lay hold of any ambiguity in the wording of the oath."</p>

<p>After a brief interval of silence the princess, knitting
her brows into a frown, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How comes the Czar to be aware of that which I revealed
to my cabinet under pledge of secrecy?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>The two ministers interchanged significant looks.</p>

<p>"The statement we are about to make," began Radzivil,
"is of so distasteful, so startling a character that we
have hitherto withheld it from your Highness, hoping
that it might prove false. In vain, however. We can no
longer blind ourselves to the fact that there is a traitor in
the cabinet."</p>

<p>"A traitor!" ejaculated Barbara.</p>

<p>"Reluctantly we are forced to this conclusion. Secrets
discussed in the privacy of our council-chamber have been
reported to the ministers of the Czar. The previous letters
of our ambassador leave no doubt on this melancholy
question."</p>

<p>Here the premier began to read various extracts, all
tending to prove his statement.</p>

<p>"One of my own ministers secretly corresponding with
the Czar!" murmured Barbara in dismay. "Who is
the traitor! Whom do you suspect, my lords?" turning
sharply upon her ministers.</p>

<p>"I know not in the least at whom to point the finger,"
replied the premier.</p>

<p>A smile flickered over Zabern's face, and he murmured
to himself, "Blind Radzivil!"</p>

<p>"You suspect some one, marshal?" said Barbara,
reading his looks.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, I do, but prefer to verify my suspicions
ere stating them. I will say this much, however,"
continued Zabern, bending forward over the table
and speaking in a whisper, "he whom I suspect is not
one of the 'Transfigured.'"</p>

<p>The princess seemed somewhat relieved by this last
statement.</p>

<p>"My spies are attentive to the traitor's movements,"
continued Zabern. "Nay, more; I have his emissary
under lock and key in the Citadel."</p>

<p>"You refer to the man Russakoff?" asked Radzivil.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. I am convinced that he is the intermediary of
this treasonable correspondence, and nothing but her
Highness's clemency prevents me from learning the name
of his principal."</p>

<p>"My clemency? How?" asked Barbara in surprise.</p>

<p>"The rack would soon make him confess."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, marshal," returned the princess, quickly.
"No prisoner shall be put to the torture during my
<i>régime</i>. I am trying to civilize Czernova. The rack
would indeed be a return to barbarism."</p>

<p>"Then we must fall back upon our secretary, Trevisa,
and pray the saints that he will unravel that cipher despatch.
It may give us the clue we want."</p>

<p>"A traitor in the cabinet!" murmured Barbara. "Russia's
arm is long and crafty; when will it be stayed?
That desire of our hearts, a war betwixt England and
Russia, seems as far off as ever."</p>

<p>"Nearer than men think," returned Zabern. "And
strange to say, our capital contains at the present moment
an Englishman whose words may have the effect of bringing
it about."</p>

<p>"Who is this potent personage?" asked Barbara in
surprise.</p>

<p>"A certain Captain Woodville, lately returned from
India."</p>

<p>Zabern had been apprised by Radzivil of the duke's
suspicion as to a former love-affair between the princess
and this English captain, and therefore while speaking
he watched Barbara with an eye ready to detect the slightest
change in her manner. But the princess showed no
confusion of face at the mention of the name "Woodville,"
and the marshal was forced to the conclusion that
the duke was laboring under an error. Or, he murmured
to himself, "the princess knows well how to hide
her feelings."</p>

<p>"Woodville? Woodville?" repeated Barbara pensively;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
and then her face brightening, she added, "Surely not
the Woodville of Tajapore renown?"</p>

<p>"The very same," replied Radzivil. "He is staying
at the Hôtel de Varsovie. I had a&mdash;a brief conversation
with him this morning."</p>

<p>At this moment the premier received from Zabern a
look which warned him to say as little as possible concerning
that interview.</p>

<p>"The siege of Tajapore!" said the princess. "Ah!
that was a noble defence. Would four hundred of our
men have done the like, think you, Zabern?" and without
waiting for reply she turned to Radzivil and asked:
"Did you inquire of Captain Woodville how long he
intends to remain in Czernova?"</p>

<p>"His stay will be very brief, I fear," replied Radzivil,
thinking of the duel and its probable issue.</p>

<p>"Very long, you mean," said Zabern in a grim whisper
to the premier, "for you believe he'll never quit
Czernova."</p>

<p>"I should like to see this illustrious Englishman ere
he departs. Count, you must arrange for an audience."</p>

<p>And the count, knowing that he was conniving at a
breaking of the law which would probably end in the
death of this same Englishman, felt extremely uncomfortable,
and but for the presence of his colleague, would
certainly have revealed the whole truth.</p>

<p>"But how," inquired Barbara, "can Captain Woodville's
words bring about an Anglo-Russian War?"</p>

<p>"Why, thus," returned Zabern. "He was interviewed
at Alexandria by the correspondent of the English
'Times,' to whom he stated his belief that the artillery
officers commanding the Afghans in their attack upon
Tajapore were really Europeans in disguise, his opinion
being based upon the superior way in which they handled
their guns. And of what nationality they were is shown
by the fact that Russian words were frequently heard in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the heat of the <i>mêlée</i>. Captain Woodville has already
embodied his views in despatches which are now under
the consideration of the British cabinet. We shall soon
have a troubling of the diplomatic waters. Lord Palmerston,
alarmed at the recent advances made by Russia in
Central Asia, is in no mood to be trifled with. He may
seize upon the siege of Tajapore as a <i>casus belli</i>. If
an Anglo-Russian war should come&mdash;"</p>

<p>Zabern checked his utterance and tapped the hilt of
his sabre significantly.</p>

<p>"Then will come the day of Poland's uprising," said
the princess with a heightened color. "My lords, you
may withdraw."</p>

<p>The premier of Czernova and the Warden of the
Charter rose, bowed, and retired, wending their way in
leisurely fashion to the entrance of the palace.</p>

<p>"Marshal," said Radzivil, with a troubled look, "the
princess seems to take great interest in this Woodville?"</p>

<p>"So much the more angry will she be with the man
who slays him," returned the other, coolly.</p>

<p>"Which is your reason for wishing this duel to take
place?" said Radzivil angrily. "You seek to destroy
my favorite scheme of uniting the princess and the
duke?"</p>

<p>"Precisely; that is my object. Her Highness will certainly
be offended at seeing her future consort presuming
to set himself above the law. It may cause her
affections to become alienated. The duke has walked
nicely into my net, as I foresaw he would."</p>

<p>"What net?"</p>

<p>"The Anti-duelling Act," replied Zabern with a cynical
smile. "Why was I so earnest in getting the Diet to
pass that measure?"</p>

<p>"To please the princess."</p>

<p>"Partly that, but much more because I saw in the
measure an opportunity of entangling the duke. Aware
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
of his arrogant disposition, I knew that he, deeming himself
above the law, would soon be engaging in another
duel. And my plan has succeeded," continued the marshall
with a triumphant chuckle. "This day the duke is
pledged to a duel with sabres. They fight <i>à la mort</i>,&mdash;that's
the best of it. It's possible they may kill each
other; if not, the alternatives are that the Englishman
will slay the duke&mdash;and may the saints confer that boon
upon Czernova!&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or, which is far more likely, the duke will slay the
Englishman."</p>

<p>"Regrettable that, since the Englishman is a fine fellow,
who deserves a better fate. In that case the duke,
in accordance with the new enactment, will have to stand
his trial for murder."</p>

<p>Radzivil stood aghast. Strange that he had not carried
the matter in thought so far as this!</p>

<p>"And if the princess adheres to the spirit and the letter
of the law," continued Zabern with imperturbable
coolness; "and, as you know, she is an enthusiast for
law, she will have to sign the warrant for the execution
of her intended consort."</p>

<p>"Good God!" gasped the premier.</p>

<p>"Works out beautifully, doesn't it? I intended it
should."</p>

<p>"Oh, this shall not be! The princess must intervene
to stop this duel. I will return at once and inform
her."</p>

<p>"Hold!" said Zabern, sternly. "Let the duke abide
by his folly and lose his bride. If Polish ascendancy is
to be maintained in Czernova the duke must go. Fool!"
he continued with a savage flash of his eyes, and forcibly
detaining the premier by the sleeve. "How long, think
you, shall we retain office if Bora once sits upon the
throne of the Lilieskis?"</p>

<p>They had now reached the grand entrance of the palace.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
A trooper moved forward to meet them and stood at the
salute, apparently wishful to deliver a message.</p>

<p>"What is it, Nikita?"</p>

<p>"Sire, the spy Russakoff has escaped from the Citadel."</p>

<p>"Damnation! the guards shall swing for this."</p>

<p>After the departure of her two ministers the Princess
Barbara, rising from her seat, passed through
an open casement into the sunlit gardens without;
the sentinels on the terrace presenting arms as she went
by.</p>

<p>A broad and noble avenue of linden trees faced her, and
here silent and without attendants the fair princess
walked, darkly meditating on the treachery latent within
her cabinet.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across her path, and, raising her eyes,
she saw before her a stately and dignified figure robed in
splendid scarlet and dainty lace.</p>

<p>It was Pasqual Ravenna, Cardinal Archbishop of Czernova,
an ecclesiastic who vainly sought to hide his Italian
origin by Polanizing his name into Ravenski.</p>

<p>He was a man who had passed his fortieth year, but he
looked far more youthful; and his clean-shaven, handsome
face was as clearly sculptured as a head on an
antique medallion.</p>

<p>He was a member of the princess's ministry, a permanent
member, in fact, for, by virtue of an antiquated
statute both the Roman archbishop and the Greek archpastor
were entitled to hold office in the cabinet&mdash;an
arrangement that did not tend to its harmony. A favor to
one was an affront to the other; and the mild and
amiable Radzivil was perpetually employed in smoothing
the differences between them.</p>

<p>Barbara's avowal to the cabinet of her real faith had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
been a great triumph for Ravenna over his Greek rival
Mosco, and he looked forward to additional triumphs.
His desire of bringing all Czernova within the papal fold
was known to all men; not so well known, however, was
his taste for amorous intrigue, though a physiognomist on
studying his countenance would have said that Ravenna,
like Cæsar, never permitted pleasure to interfere with
ambition.</p>

<p>Doffing his red beretta the cardinal bent his knee and
raised the princess's hand to his lips. It was clear at a
glance that Ravenna was not a <i>persona grata</i> with Barbara,
for though she did not withdraw her hand her face
assumed a cold expression.</p>

<p>With an air of authority he took his place on the left
side of the princess, and began to pace to and fro with her
beneath the shade of the linden trees.</p>

<p>"Princess, I have returned, as you see, from the Vatican,
the bearer of a missive from his Holiness, Pope
Pius."</p>

<p>He presented a massive envelope, its seal stamped with
the papal keys. But Barbara waved it aside. She had
received many such epistles of late, and the novelty was
wearing off.</p>

<p>"You know its contents, I presume. Read it for me.
What says his Holiness?"</p>

<p>Ravenna broke the seal and unfolded the letter which
was a somewhat lengthy one, and written in the choicest
Latinity.</p>

<p>"The Holy Father greets you as his dear daughter <i>in
Christo</i>, and, as you are now firmly established upon the
throne"&mdash;Barbara could not repress a smile in view of
the recent menace of the Czar&mdash;"he deems that the time
is ripe for the public avowal of your faith."</p>

<p>"At last the Pope and I are at one. This night shall
Radzivil make known my faith to the Diet. I ever loathed
this garb of secrecy and hypocrisy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>"Its assumption was necessary. The saints themselves
must bow in the house of Rimmon at times."</p>

<p>"Would that I could drop the other deception and
reign in my own name!" murmured Barbara to herself.</p>

<p>"His Holiness," proceeded the cardinal, glancing at the
papal missive, "anticipates the happy day when Czernova
shall be purified from the malaria of heresy that now
taints it."</p>

<p>"And in what way does he suggest that the purificatory
process shall begin?" said the princess with a slight
frown.</p>

<p>"His Holiness hath ventured in this epistle to briefly
indicate the lines of the ecclesiastical policy to be observed
within the principality. We must begin by penalizing the
schismatic Greeks. The Diet must pass a law to exclude
them from holding civil offices."</p>

<p>"And create a rebellion!" murmured Barbara. "These
priests! will they never learn wisdom?" And aloud she
asked, "And would your Eminence have me exclude the
Duke of Bora, my future consort, both from the cabinet
and the Diet?"</p>

<p>"Your future consort? Alas, princess, I regret to say
that the Pope has again refused to grant you dispensation
to marry the duke."</p>

<p>"We shall not ask a third time."</p>

<p>"Your Highness cheerfully accepts his decision?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it is my intention to marry without
the papal sanction. I must," she added, her expression
showing how hateful to her was the thought of such marriage&mdash;"I
must conciliate my Muscovite subjects."</p>

<p>"Princess, you, as a vassal of the holy Roman
suzerain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By your leave, Sir Cardinal," exclaimed Barbara,
haughtily, "will you cite the Act by which the Diet consented
that Czernova should become a fief of the Papal
See?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first time that Barbara had adopted such a
tone with Ravenna, who listened, however, without betraying
surprise; for he was one of those men whose
outward serenity nothing seems to disturb, and therein
lay one of the secrets of his power. He clearly recognized
that a struggle was impending. The princess, hitherto
compliant with his will, was about to make an attempt to
shake off his authority.</p>

<p>"Princess, you, as a loyal daughter of the True
Church&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Daughter! that is a good word. A daughter is not a
slave."</p>

<p>"But she owes obedience. You cannot marry the duke,
for the Holy Father forbids the union, and no Catholic
priest dare perform the ceremony in opposition to the will
of Pio Nono."</p>

<p>"There is one brave priest in Czernova upon whose
loyalty I can rely."</p>

<p>"You allude to the Abbot Faustus, a lawless ecclesiastic
who must learn to discipline his proud soul. If your
Highness will glance at this missive, you will note that
the Pope has conferred upon me full jurisdiction over the
Convent of the Transfiguration."</p>

<p>"A convent whose abbot from old time hath been independent
of the see of Slavowitz! You will put Faustus in
a dilemma," continued Barbara with a touch of sarcasm
in her voice; "he will not know which of the two Infallibilities
to follow: Pius II., who granted the convent its
privileges, or Pius IX., who abolishes them. I greatly fear
that he will follow the old Pope in preference to the new."</p>

<p>Barbara would have repudiated the statement that she
was not a true Catholic. Nevertheless it is to be seen that
her Catholicism like many other things in Czernova was
peculiarly <i>sui generis</i>.</p>

<p>"And your Highness supports Faustus in his defiance
of the archbishop?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>The princess shrugged her graceful shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am aware that your Eminence is extremely anxious
to regulate the affairs of that convent, and that Faustus in
the exercise of his ancient rights declines to admit you
within his walls. It is no concern of mine if an abbot
refuse to obey his archbishop."</p>

<p>"Still, a word from the princess would procure his
instant submission."</p>

<p>"And that word shall never be spoken."</p>

<p>"The Convent of the Transfiguration must hide strange
mysteries behind its walls when the Pope's own nuncio is
denied admission."</p>

<p>There was on the part of the princess a sudden start,
which the cardinal accepted as confirmatory of his
suspicion.</p>

<p>"Princess," he said with a smile, "you are not yet perfect
in statecraft, for you have not learned the art of
veiling your thoughts. It is as I have long suspected;
you have some secret connected with that monastery.
Your championing of Abbot Faustus is not altogether
disinterested."</p>

<p>"Quit me this theme," said Barbara, with dignity. "I
shall not misuse my authority to gratify your ambition
by depriving a brave abbot of his ancient privileges. Indeed
from this day forth it will be well for each of us to
understand the other, inasmuch as you seem strangely
disposed to reverse our respective positions, deeming
yourself the ruler of Czernova, and myself your minister."
She paused for a moment as if to collect her thoughts, and
then resumed: "My lord cardinal, under strange circumstances
you stole me away in infancy, deluding my
father into the belief that I had died. You took charge of
my training and education&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With a view to your ultimate restoration," said the
cardinal, bowing.</p>

<p>"True. You desire to present the Czernovese with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
princess who should be a Catholic, and not, as her forefathers
had been, a member of the Greek faith&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A noble aim!"</p>

<p>"A princess who should be a willing tool in the hands
of the Latin Church. The first part of your scheme has
succeeded. I am a Catholic, and shall never break with
the faith of my childhood, for it has grown dear to me,
though the thought that you, my lord, belong to the same
faith might very well induce me to renounce it. But as to
the second part of your scheme&mdash;your expectation of
finding in me a servile instrument ready to execute every
decree of the Papal See is destined to failure. No priest
shall dictate to the daughter of Thaddeus. Let the crosier
submit to the sceptre. Jesuits by their intolerance contributed
to the fall of old Poland. They shall not play
their game in Czernova."</p>

<p>The cardinal listened with chiding smile, as if at the
waywardness of a pretty child.</p>

<p>"Princess! princess! you forget the tenure by which
you hold your crown."</p>

<p>"I hold my crown," said Barbara, with proud flashing
eyes, "by right of birth."</p>

<p>"A right that you cannot prove without my witness."</p>

<p>"And therefore you would use your knowledge?"</p>

<p>"To advance in Czernova the interests of the True
Church."</p>

<p>"For that I could forgive you. But have you no
ulterior aim? Shall I unmask the secret purpose of your
heart? Radzivil made an unwise choice in sending you
to the Vatican to plead for the dispensation. Were you
really urgent on my behalf?"</p>

<p>"As urgent as one may be with a pope."</p>

<p>"Hypocrite!" said the princess, turning upon the
cardinal with a blaze of scorn. "Can I not see you now
in my mind's eye whispering in the ear of the Pope to
withhold the dispensation? And why? The heretical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
duke must not marry the princess, because the cardinal
would have her for his secret mistress. Will you say that
I wrong you by this thought?"</p>

<p>"Princess, you have rightly divined my secret. It is
true that I love you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would that Zabern could hear you!" said Barbara
indignantly. "You, a priest, to talk to your princess of
love!"</p>

<p>It was significant that the marshal's name, and not that
of Bora, should be the first to rise to her lips.</p>

<p>"A priest? True. Such is my misfortune, since once
a priest always a priest. My love for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let there be an end of this language," said Barbara
with dignity. "It is treason."</p>

<p>"Nay, princess, listen. I have loved you in secret from
the day when I set eyes on you in the Dalmatian convent.
I have elevated you to a throne partly for the purpose of
making you mine, that you might taste the luxury of
power, and, tasting, be ready to sacrifice anything, even
your own person, rather than lose that power. Aware
of my love, you are forming a plan to escape me. If you
should be deposed, who succeeds? The Duke of Bora as
next of kin. Therefore you think by becoming his wife
to retain your rank as princess, and thus to foil my hopes.
That motive, rather than a desire to conciliate the Muscovite
faction, urges you to this match."</p>

<p>His statement was perhaps correct, for Barbara did not
offer any denial to it.</p>

<p>"But be mindful of this: the duke cares less for you
than for your crown. At heart he dislikes you, for he
finds his solemn dulness an ill match for your bright wit.
I have but to whisper to him that your title is invalid, and
he will be the first to demand your deposition. It will not
be difficult to prove that you are an impostor. The physicians
and nurses who attended the infant days of Princess
Natalie are still living. The simple baring of your right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
shoulder would prove that, whoever you may be, you are
not that princess. Your assertion that nevertheless you
are her elder and half-sister would be laughed to scorn.
Who will believe your word, unsupported by evidence,
that the late Prince Thaddeus had contracted an early and
secret marriage? The whole affair would be regarded as
a plot on the part of Cardinal Ravenna formed to advance
the interests of his Church. Barbara Lilieska, I acknowledge
you to be the lawful Princess of Czernova,
but whenever it shall please me I can compel you to step
down from your throne."</p>

<p>Barbara quivered with indignation. She, a princess
with the blood of Polish kings in her veins, and at whose
word twenty thousand swords would flash from their
scabbards, to be threatened by an Italian ecclesiastic!
She turned her head towards the armed sentinels slowly
pacing the stately terrace of the palace.</p>

<p>"One moment, princess, ere ordering my arrest. I do
not venture upon this avowal without safeguarding myself.
Listen! There lives at the present moment upon
the other side of the frontier&mdash;in what town no matter&mdash;an
individual devoted to my interests. To him I have
entrusted the keeping of three sealed packets. So soon
as he shall learn of my arrest he will thus act. One packet
he will despatch to the Russian Foreign Minister; the
second to the Duke of Bora; and with the third he will
hasten to the office of the 'Kolokol' newspaper, whose
pro-Russian editor, Lipski, will be but too delighted to
print the contents of that packet; its publication will cause
a stir in Czernova. There are your guards. Call them.
Arrest me. Behead me on the spot if you will. But be
sure of this: your own downfall will follow within seven
days."</p>

<p>Barbara did not call her guards. She said nothing, did
nothing.</p>

<p>"Princess, forgive me for using the language of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
threats; it is with reluctance that I adopt such a course.
But&mdash;you recognize my power, and you know my love.
Your answer?"</p>

<p>"Better the cloister's quiet shade than a throne on such
terms."</p>

<p>"It is not the cloister's quiet shade that you will see,
but the interior of a Russian fortress. In occupying the
throne of Czernova you will be accused of assuming rights
the reversion of which belongs to the Czar, inasmuch as
he is next heir after the duke. The Czar will see in your
usurpation an affront to his dignity. He will demand that
you be sent to Russia, there to take your trial. And the
cowardly duke will comply. You know how much 'the
politician in petticoats' is hated by the Russian ministry,
and what justice you are likely to receive at their hands.
When the black wall of a Muscovite fortress girdles you
round forever," he added in a significant whisper, "when
rough soldiers are your jailers, when no cry of yours can
penetrate to the outer world, then&mdash;then the love of a
cardinal even would be a desirable thing."</p>

<p>Barbara could not repress a feeling of horror at the
picture suggested by these words.</p>

<p>"If the duke should rule he will rule merely as the
vassal of the Czar, and Czernova will become a province
of Russia. Therefore, consider well your decision. You
ruin not yourself only, but the faithful friends dependent
upon you. Zabern, Radzivil, Dorislas, all the ministers
whose policy has offended the Czar, will be delivered up
to him by the duke. Czernova will be overrun by Cossack
soldiery, and placed under martial law. Her young men
will be drafted off to serve in the Russian army. The
university will be closed, the Catholic Church persecuted.
The wailings of Czernova will mount upward to Heaven,
but when did Heaven ever listen to the cry of the oppressed?
Princess, it is true I require of you a sacrifice,
but it is a sacrifice meriting the name of virtue. The fate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
of a nation hangs upon your answer. How easy for you
to save them by conferring happiness upon me!"</p>

<p>He could not have employed an argument more adapted
to gain his end than an appeal to the welfare of the people
whom she loved; nevertheless, it had altogether failed, as
he saw by the sovereign scorn that curved her lips.</p>

<p>"You are master of my secret, but not of me. Though
I err in bearing the name of Natalie, I am nevertheless
the lawful princess of Czernova; and Heaven, being just,
will maintain me in my rights. He sets himself a hard
task, cardinal, who proposes to fight against the truth.
Reveal my story to the duke&mdash;to the Diet, to the whole
principality&mdash;this very day, if you will. I fear you not.
I will do nothing to stop you. I will wait to see whether
you will be bold enough to play this traitor's game. And
when you have done your worst to destroy the princess,
and failed, then beware the vengeance of Zabern; for
though you fly to the secret recesses of the Vatican, and
cling to the holy robe of Pio Nono himself, Zabern will
find and slay you. There is my answer both to your
threats and to your lust, for call not your desires by the
sacred name of love."</p>

<p>The cardinal gave a mock bow.</p>

<p>"Princess, I will not yet draw the sword against you,
confident that time and reflection will bring you wisdom.
Reign till your coronation-eve, when I will return to this
theme."</p>

<p>His cold smile gave little indication of the volcano of
passion that was burning within him. The sight of the
distant sentinels alone kept him from seizing and holding
Barbara within his arms. Brilliant in youth and loveliness
she tortured him; and he resolved to torture in turn,
since the means of doing so were at his disposal.</p>

<p>"Ere I take my leave," he said, "let me tell you of an
event that took place this morning. Nay, princess, do not
turn away. The story will interest you as no other story
can."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>Something in Ravenna's manner compelled Barbara to
pause and face him again.</p>

<p>"Princess, prepare yourself for a surprise. One whom
we both thought dead now proves to be living."</p>

<p>Despite her loathing of the cardinal, Barbara found
herself forced to utter one word,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"One whose supposed demise caused you to say
that you would forever carry a dead heart within your
breast."</p>

<p>The princess gave a great start, and placed her hand
upon her side. With a foreboding of what was to come
she stood immovable, mute, scarcely breathing.</p>

<p>"Isola Sacra was certainly submerged. We both saw
that. But ere it sank the captive must have escaped, for a
young Englishman calling himself Paul Cressingham
Woodville put up last evening at the Hôtel de Varsovie."</p>

<p>Barbara was powerless to speak, but the look in her
eyes was a language that plainly said, "Is it the same?"</p>

<p>The cardinal understood her silent question.</p>

<p>"The same. For verification I sent to the Police
Bureau where strangers register themselves. These little
particulars on his <i>carte de séjour</i> leave no doubt on the
matter."</p>

<p>Here Ravenna drew forth a paper and began reading
from it. "'Name: Paul Woodville, formerly Paul Cressingham.
Age: twenty-seven. Nationality: English.
Residence: Oriel Hall, Kent, England. Religion: Anglican
Church. Calling: Captain in the Twenty-fourth
Kentish, a cavalry regiment. Object in visiting Czernova:
The pleasure of travelling,' Humph! was that the
motive that drew him here? Princess, do you mark the
name Woodville? Your Dalmatian hero has been distinguishing
himself, for he is none other than the Englishman
who conducted the defence of Tajapore."</p>

<p>Emotion caused Barbara to sink upon a marble seat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
She knew that Ravenna was speaking, but she heard not
his words. She was oblivious of everything, but the one
overwhelming thought that Paul was alive, and at that
very moment within her own city of Slavowitz!</p>

<p>Her feelings were eloquently testified by the new and
radiant light that came over her face, by her lips parted in
an unconscious smile, by her bosom heaving beneath its
foam of white lace. Never had the princess looked so
lovely in the cardinal's eyes as now. Lost in a delicious
daze she was quite forgetful of his presence, as he himself
perceived, for two or three questions addressed to her
evoked no recognition.</p>

<p>Her pleasure struck a pang to his jealous heart. What
would he not have given to be the cause of such transfiguration?
But though he could not create such joy, he
could extinguish it, and would; and observing that Barbara
was awaking from her day-dream, and endeavoring
to fix her attention upon him, he proceeded,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville&mdash;to call him by his new name&mdash;saw
you this morning from the balcony of the Hôtel de
Varsovie. Knowing that you cannot really be Natalie
Lilieska he will, of course, conclude that you are an
impostor."</p>

<p>How could Paul, ignorant of her true history, come to
any other conclusion? The thought sent a sudden chill to
her warm feelings.</p>

<p>"These Englishmen pride themselves on their blunt
honesty and plain dealing. What will he think when he
sees that in the sacred matter of religion you are acting
the hypocrite, in secret a Catholic, yet for the sake of self-interest
publicly posing as a Greek!"</p>

<p>Yes; it was true. In name and religion she was a
living lie. How she must have fallen in Paul's esteem!
Her quickly changing expression gave pleasure to the
cardinal.</p>

<p>"He saw the duke publicly kiss your hand, and must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
thus have learned of your betrothal. Inquiries as to
Bora's character must cause him to marvel at the taste
which selects this Scythian barbarian for your consort."</p>

<p>Every word went, as intended, to Barbara's heart.
Paul, not knowing that she had believed him dead, must
have thought himself forgotten by her. How she longed
to see him, to explain the difficulties of her position, to set
matters right between them!</p>

<p>Regardless of what court officials might think, she
would send an equerry this same day to the Hôtel de
Varsovie with a message to the effect that the Princess of
Czernova was desirous of an interview with Captain Paul
Woodville.</p>

<p>"If it be sweet to learn that the dear friends whom we
have long thought dead are alive, how bitter it must be to
lose them again, ere we can have the opportunity of seeing
them!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Barbara did not speak these words. The question was
put by the eager, fearful look of her eyes.</p>

<p>"It seems that the duke and Captain Woodville&mdash;I
crave your Highness's pardon, Captain Woodville and the
duke&mdash;met by chance on the balcony of the Hôtel de
Varsovie. A sapphire seal worn by the Englishman attracted
the notice of the duke, inasmuch as he recognized
it as a former gift of his to the Princess Natalie. The
Englishman refused to state how he came by its possession,
with the result that there is to be a duel over the
matter."</p>

<p>"Mother of God!"</p>

<p>But for her dark arched eyebrows and dusky glowing
eyes, the princess's face might have been taken for a piece
of white sculpture.</p>

<p>"It is to be no mock contest. They fight with sabres
and to the death."</p>

<p>"They shall not fight," gasped Barbara, finding her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
voice at last. "I shall send a troop to the Ducal Palace to
arrest Bora&mdash;now&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>"Too late! princess," answered Ravenna in a mocking
voice. "They fight this very day, within an hour from
now. The combatants are already on their way to the
rendezvous in the Red Forest. The swiftest horse of the
Ukraine could not reach the spot in time for you to stay
the duel. And granting that you should arrive in time
you would be powerless; for, in order to avoid breaking
the Czernovese law, Ostrova, the duke's second, has fixed
the place of combat on the Russian side of the frontier,
where your authority does not extend."</p>

<p>White as the princess's face was it grew whiter still as
Ravenna proceeded in a fierce exultant tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know the duke's reputation as a <i>beau sabreur</i>.
Thirty duels, and never a wound has he received in any
one of them; that is his record. In the Czernovese army
are twenty thousand men, not one of whom, unless he
wish for death, dares face the duke's deadly blade. You
yourself have witnessed his feats in the <i>salle d'armes</i>;
you have seen him disarm in swift succession the best
fencers among your officers.&mdash;Zabern, Dorislas, Miroslav!
Who can stand before the duke?"</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and then, pointing to the sun
shimmering through the leaves of the linden-trees, he
added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Princess, ere that golden orb has set, your English
hero will be lying dead upon the turf, slain by the hand
of the man whom you would make your husband."</p>

<p>Barbara heard no more. With a cry of "O Paul,
Paul,"&mdash;a cry in which love and grief were intermingled,&mdash;she
slid from her seat, and lay as one dead at the feet
of the cardinal.
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER V<br /><br />
ON THE RUSSIAN FRONTIER</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to a close as Paul
Woodville and Noel Trevisa made their way to
the frontiers of Czernova.</p>

<p>From Slavowitz they had driven in a troika or three-horse
car, adopting by preconcerted arrangement a route
different from that taken by Bora and his second.</p>

<p>Having put up their vehicle at a roadside hostelry,
Trevisa conducted his friend to the place of assignation,
the path lying through a series of charming woodland
glades, collectively known as the Red Forest.</p>

<p>"Grand pines!" remarked Paul, admiring the erect
and stately columns presented by these trees.</p>

<p>"The haunt of wolves in winter," observed Trevisa.
"They sometimes devour the Russian sentinels. Who
henceforth shall say that a wolf has not its uses?"</p>

<p>Following the beaten track, they came to an extensive
clearing.</p>

<p>"The frontier line runs somewhere through this glade.
Yes; there is the boundary mark."</p>

<p>Trevisa directed Paul's attention to an upright rectangular
block of stone, the sides of which fronted the
four cardinal points. On the northern face, deeply cut,
were the letters R-U-S-S-I-A, and on the southern face
C-Z-E-R-N-O-V-A.</p>

<p>"We are now breathing the air of despotism," remarked
Trevisa, as they left the stone in their rear, "and
unless we keep a lookout we may experience the effects
of it in a shot fired at us by some hidden sentinel."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>"What? Is it the fashion of Russian sentries to take
pot-shots at passing strangers?"</p>

<p>"Occasionally; at least, on this frontier. It is purposely
done to provoke hostilities from Czernova. Ah!
there's a sentry. I thought we shouldn't advance far
without meeting one."</p>

<p>There under the shadow of the trees, about a hundred
yards distant, sitting on horseback with lance erect, was
a wild-looking Cossack, with Hessian boots, red breeches,
and a small red turban-shaped cap. He was chanting
the Russian anthem, and his voice, mellowed by the distance,
had a strange plaintive effect.</p>

<p>The sight of this equestrian was well calculated to stir
reflection in Paul's mind.</p>

<p>Far, far away on the icy shores of Kamchatka other
Russian sentinels were keeping watch. The distance
between the two frontiers was over six thousand miles
as the crow flies.</p>

<p>And this empire, so colossal in extent, the very incarnation
of military force, was threatening little Czernova,
Barbara's own principality! There was no hope of her
emerging victorious from the contest. The very idea
was insanity. She would be but as an infant struggling
in the hands of a giant. And the nations of Europe
would look on unmoved, as they have often looked on
and condoned the conquest of the Weak by the Strong.
There was none to pity or help her. And as Paul thought
of all this his heart grew hot within him. He began to
feel something of the spirit that animated the Polish patriots
of Czernova.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Cossack sentinel, catching sight of
strangers, turned his horse's head in their direction, and
lowering his lance, he came on at full speed.</p>

<p>On nearing the two friends he reined in his shaggy
steed with such quickness as to throw the animal almost
on its haunches.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>"Your passport, little fathers?"</p>

<p>"Here is the universal passport, in Russia as elsewhere&mdash;cash,"
replied Trevisa, displaying some rouble-notes.
"We come no farther, and are here simply to
fight a duel."</p>

<p>"A duel! That's against the law of Russia. The
guard-house is but half-a-mile distant among those trees
yonder," said the Cossack, indicating the direction with
his lance. "The captain is a terrible fellow. If he
should come this way he'll order your arrest and mine
too."</p>

<p>"Not he. He'll be only too pleased to witness a good
fight. Besides, we have rouble-notes for him also. He
has his price, I dare be sworn, otherwise he would be a
novelty among Muscovites."</p>

<p>The Cossack reflected. A duel was a pleasant thing;
a <i>douceur</i> still more pleasant. Why, then, seek to prevent
the fight? He would take his chance of discovery
at the hands of his captain. So having first looked cautiously
round, he stuffed the rouble-notes into his left
boot and made no more opposition.</p>

<p>"Let the Czernovese slay each other," he muttered.
"The fewer for our Czar to fight when the talked-of war
takes place."</p>

<p>"We are first on the field, it seems," remarked Trevisa,
referring to his watch. "Hum! five minutes yet
to the appointed time."</p>

<p>Paul having presented the Cossack with a cigar,
lighted one himself, and paced leisurely to and fro,
seemingly far more at ease than his second.</p>

<p>"This duel is a very serious matter," muttered Trevisa.</p>

<p>"One can die but once."</p>

<p>"Just so. If one could die half-a-dozen times the first
death would not matter much. I, however, am not anticipating
your death, Paul, but the duke's. You may be
doing grave hurt to the princess by killing him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>"How so? Have you not said that it would be a good
thing if the princess could be released from him?"</p>

<p>"True; but your way of releasing her has its disadvantages.
Forget not that the duke is a near kinsman of
the Czar, and that at the present time the Czar hath no
great love for Czernova. If Bora should fall Nicholas
may accuse the Czernovese cabinet of being privy to
the death of his kinsman, and with some show of justice,
inasmuch as Radzivil, the premier, though cognizant of
the coming duel, has taken no steps to prevent it. You
perceive my meaning. The Czar might demand an indemnity
such as he foreknows that Czernova could not,
and would not pay. The result&mdash;annexation of the
principality."</p>

<p>Paul reflected a moment.</p>

<p>"The duel was to have been <i>à la mort</i>, and I came intending
to kill or be killed, but your remark has set the
matter in a different light. I cannot retire nor apologize
without loss of honor, yet it is equally clear that I must
do nothing to the hurt of the princess. There's but one
way out of the difficulty: I'll so wound him that he shall
not be able to use sword-arm for a month."</p>

<p>"If you can do that&mdash;well," replied Trevisa, very
much doubting, however, Paul's ability to make good
his word, for was not John the Strong the most expert
swordsman in Czernova?</p>

<p>It was quite thirty minutes after the appointed time
when the Duke of Bora made his appearance attended
by his second, Baron Ostrova. They brought no surgeon
with them, for Ostrova, in arrogant vein, had declared
that his principal had never yet required one; and Trevisa,
not to be outdone in bravado, had made the same
avowal respecting Paul.</p>

<p>While the duke remained at a little distance his second
advanced, gracefully raising his hat to Trevisa.</p>

<p>"You are late, baron."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>"Accept our sincere regret. Our vehicle broke down
on the way." Then, adopting a somewhat submissive
air, and addressing Paul and Trevisa in common, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can we not terminate this little matter amicably?
His grace is willing to apologize for his hasty action of
this morning."</p>

<p>To do the duke justice, it was not Paul's sword that
he feared, but loss of the princess. During the course
of the day he had begun to realize the force of Radzivil's
words,&mdash;that if the affair should come to the knowledge
of the princess it might seriously affect the projected
marriage.</p>

<p>He would, therefore, swallow his pride, and for the
first time in his career as duellist cry off from the combat
by making an apology.</p>

<p>"All's well that ends well!" murmured the delighted
Trevisa. "You'll accept the <i>amende honorable</i>, Paul?"</p>

<p>But Paul seemed bent on chastising the duke.</p>

<p>"It is pleasant to learn," he said, speaking sufficiently
loud for Bora to hear, "that his grace realizes that he
has acted like a ruffian. 'Liar' and 'coward' were the
epithets he applied to me; his action, a cane-stroke across
my cheek. And now does he deem that simply to express
regret will be a sufficient satisfaction for an affront offered
to the uniform of the Twenty-fourth? Well, I will
accept the apology on this condition," continued Paul,
breaking a slender sapling from a tree overhead and
leisurely stripping off the foliage, "that the duke's cheek
shall receive from this wand a stroke similar to that bestowed
upon mine. It will be a convincing token of his
repentance."</p>

<p>Ostrova, to whom had been committed the charge of
bringing the weapons, smiled satirically, and presented
two sheathed sabres to Trevisa.</p>

<p>"Take your choice."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>Trevisa first measured the blades, and finding them of
equal length next proceeded to test their temper; and
then, having made his selection, handed the same to Paul,
who in the meantime had doffed his coat and vest and
now stood ready for the fray.</p>

<p>The victor in thirty duels, humiliated beyond measure
at the rejection of his conciliatory address, did not wait
for further preliminaries but snatched the remaining
sabre from the hand of Ostrova, and with the fury of a
lion darting upon his victim, he flew upon Paul as if
purposing to lay him <i>hors de combat</i> at the first brunt.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the heavy sabres clashed together,
sparkling in the rays of the setting sun, when there came
the command,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let fall your swords in the name of the law."</p>

<p>The words were spoken in a woman's voice,&mdash;a voice
that sent a thrill to Paul's heart.</p>

<p>Parrying a thrust from the duke, Paul took a swift
backward step, and while maintaining his defensive attitude,
contrived to glance sideways.</p>

<p>And there, beautiful and pale, and so close to him that
he could see into her eyes, was Barbara, breathless as if
from hurrying. From what quarter she had so suddenly
sprung none present could tell. Complete absorption in
the duel had prevented them from hearing her light footfall
upon the turf of the woodland.</p>

<p>Paul forgot his guard. He forgot everything. From
sheer surprise his sword dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>He looked at her in silence, striving to learn what were
her feelings towards him. She gave no token of recognition.
Love on her part, if it existed, was veiled at present
in sorrowful reproach. In the light of that look how
ignoble seemed his desire for vengeance. His glance fell
even as his sword had fallen. He had acted, and knowingly
acted, in a way calculated to forfeit her esteem.</p>

<p>A death-like stillness fell upon the circle as they perceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
that the fair princess of Czernova, sternly hostile
to duelling, was present, a spectator of their misdeed.
True, she was but one maiden, but that maiden symbolized
in her own person all the power of a state.</p>

<p>"Who first proposed this duel? Who issued the
challenge?"</p>

<p>"I did, and with reason."</p>

<p>And stalking up to the princess, the Duke of Bora bent
his head, and said in a fierce, jealous whisper,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin Natalie, how comes yon fellow to be in possession
of the seal I gave you?"</p>

<p>The princess stepped backward, and drawing her robe
around her with a stately grace, she exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It ill becomes one of my ministers to be found setting
himself above the law. Marshal, conduct your prisoner
to the Citadel."</p>

<p>Paul, following the wave of her arm, perceived that
she had not come without an escort.</p>

<p>On the Czernovese side of the frontier-stone stood
Marshal Zabern with folded arms, outwardly as inscrutable
as the sphinx, inwardly delighted at the course
taken by events.</p>

<p>Some distance in his rear, drawn up across the woodland
path, the narrowness of which did not admit of
more than two abreast, was a posse of mounted lancers
belonging to the Blue Legion. Fronting these troopers
was the vehicle evidently used by the princess in her
journey to this spot,&mdash;a light, elegant droshky, expressly
adapted for swift travelling.</p>

<p>And the Cossack sentinel, likewise noting all this, felt
ill at ease. The sound of his bugle would instantly have
summoned a party from the Russian guard-house, but as
this might have led to the exposure of his own participation
in the affair, he refrained from the act, and looked
on in silence.</p>

<p>"Marshal, conduct your prisoner to the Citadel."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>"You would arrest <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>There was an emphasis on the last word which was
intended to remind the princess that it behoved her to
consider who he was. It was clear to her that relying on
his kinship to the Czar, he set little store by the law of
Czernova. His pitying smile cut the constitutionalist
princess to the quick.</p>

<p>"You talk bravely, fair cousin, forgetful in whose territory
you now stand. I put myself under the protection
of this sentry, the representative of the Czar."</p>

<p>The duke was not mending matters in appealing to the
Czar for protection against the law of Czernova.</p>

<p>"O silly duke!" murmured Zabern. "How nicely
you are playing into my hands! You have lost the princess
by that speech."</p>

<p>The Cossack sentinel, now heartily regretting that he
had become compromised by an affair in which the great
ones of Czernova were involved, nevertheless at the
duke's abjuration rode off to the princess.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he cried, with an air of authority.
"Prisoner? No arrest can take place here. Little
mother, you are standing on Russian ground; therefore&mdash;your
passport, signed by the Russian consul at
Slavowitz."</p>

<p>"Princesses do not carry passports," replied Barbara
disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Then the little mother must retire to her own side of
the frontier."</p>

<p>Barbara seemed disposed at first to maintain her
ground, but wiser thoughts prevailed.</p>

<p>"You do but your duty," she replied.</p>

<p>And with this she retired, and took her station by the
side of Zabern.</p>

<p>"Princess, I commend your celerity," smiled the marshal.
"I was five years in getting out of Russia,&mdash;you
have accomplished it in as many seconds."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>Then lowering his voice to a whisper, he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We cannot arrest the duke while he is on Russian
ground. Were we to do so, this Cossack would report
the matter. In their present mood Russian ministers
would gladly seize upon the violation of their territory
as a <i>casus belli</i>, and we don't want war at present."</p>

<p>"John Lilieski," said the princess, addressing the duke
from her own side of the frontier, "you will either return
under guard to Slavowitz, or you will not return at
all. Take your choice betwixt imprisonment during my
pleasure, or perpetual banishment from Czernova."</p>

<p>This decision from one whom he had been accustomed
to regard as his affianced bride completely confounded his
grace of Bora. His first surprise over, he proceeded to
take counsel with his second. Though they spoke in low
tones, Paul nevertheless caught a few words.</p>

<p>"They dare not harm you," said Ostrova, "and you
will command more interest, more sympathy, more power
as a prisoner in the Citadel than as a hanger-on at the
Czar's court."</p>

<p>This argument seemed to decide the duke, for he immediately
crossed to the Czernovese side.</p>

<p>"Since you make a voluntary surrender of yourself,"
said the princess, "declare it aloud that the Russian
sentry may hear you."</p>

<p>"Of my own free will I enter the Czernovese territory,"
said Bora, addressing the Cossack.</p>

<p>"Your sword," said Zabern.</p>

<p>Though not as yet deposed from his command of the
army, Bora did not doubt that this would follow, and
that Zabern would be his successor. Very bitter, indeed,
then, was his smile as he handed the sabre over to the
marshal.</p>

<p>"I am curious to learn, fair cousin," he sneered, "the
punishment you reserve for my opponent, equally guilty
with myself of breaking the law."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"There is your escort to Slavowitz," said Barbara
haughtily, pointing to the posse of uhlans.</p>

<p>And Bora, with a dark glance at Paul, walked in the
direction indicated.</p>

<p>"For my part," observed Baron Ostrova airily, "I
prefer liberty. I shake the dust of Czernova from my
feet."</p>

<p>"Forever," decreed the princess.</p>

<p>"Oh, your Highness, your reign will not last so long
as that," replied the other, with a peculiar smile, adding
to himself, "Your reign, my lady, is but a question of a
few weeks."</p>

<p>Taking off his hat, he dropped it to the ground, and
bowed so low over it as almost to touch the turf with his
fingers, herein imitating an old custom of the Polish serf
when addressing his lord.</p>

<p>"I kiss the feet of the dainty Lady Natalie," he
said.</p>

<p>Then, picking up his hat, the Baron walked off to a
little distance, where he stood watching the sequel.</p>

<p>Paul longed to thrash the fellow for his insolence, but
prudently refrained from creating a disturbance in Russian
territory.</p>

<p>"Trevisa," said the princess, "in remembrance of
your many services I remit the penalty due by law, but,"
and there was genuine sorrow in her tone, "you lose
your secretaryship."</p>

<p>"Your Highness," stammered Trevisa, his whole
manner showing how deeply he felt the loss of his
office. "Fine. Imprisonment. Any punishment but
that."</p>

<p>"The cipher, your Highness," murmured Zabern.
"The cipher letter! We cannot do without Trevisa."</p>

<p>"Let me intercede for him," said Paul, bending his
knee.</p>

<p>The princess had last heard that voice in the twilight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
hour by the dark blue sea on the shore of Isola Sacra.
The memory of that event came back with a rush that
almost stifled her breath.</p>

<p>"His only fault is," pleaded Paul, "that he has been
too great a friend."</p>

<p>"To you, but not to our law," she murmured faintly.
"My servants must not be law-breakers."</p>

<p>There was a brief interval of silence.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," said Paul, rising to his feet, "I
await my sentence."</p>

<p>"You are safe where you stand," she faltered.</p>

<p>Her manner plainly besought him to remain where he
was, and thus relieve her from a painful situation.</p>

<p>"I will not take advantage of <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>And by a few steps Paul passed from the jurisdiction
of the Czar to that of Barbara.</p>

<p>The look in her eyes was like that of a fawn at bay.
Love forbade her to punish Paul, and yet, while meting
punishment to others, how, without bringing reproach
to herself, could she let him go free?</p>

<p>"Your Highness," intervened Trevisa, "my friend
Captain Woodville has received extreme provocation
from the duke, and when he accepted the challenge, was
ignorant of the Czernovese law relating to duelling."</p>

<p>Barbara had heard the whole story from Zabern as she
was whirled along in the droshky from Slavowitz to the
frontier. She glanced at the weal that disfigured Paul's
cheek, and her anger grew hot against the duke. No!
come what might, she would not punish Paul.</p>

<p>"I appeal to the marshal," said Trevisa boldly,
"whether he would not have taken to the sword under
the like provocation."</p>

<p>"Princess," replied Zabern, "Captain Woodville, as a
soldier, had no other course than to maintain the honor
of his queen's uniform." The foolish Barbara became
jealous at the thought that Paul should owe allegiance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
to a lady other than herself. Lowering his voice to a
whisper, Zabern continued, "Your Highness has authority
to imprison the duke, inasmuch as he is your own
subject; but you will be exceeding that authority if you
venture to arrest an English citizen for an offence committed
on Russian ground. Let the Russians themselves
see to it."</p>

<p>The princess flashed a quick glance of interrogation at
him.</p>

<p>"What would you imply? That the Russians will demand
Captain Woodville's extradition?"</p>

<p>"I clearly foresee that they will try to make political
capital out of this affair. Be sure that Baron Ostrova
will give them his version of it. Always excepting your
Highness and myself," continued Zabern with a grim
smile, "there is no one upon whom the Russian Government
would more willingly lay hands than the Englishman
who prevented them from taking the Afghan fortress
of Tajapore."</p>

<p>This reference to Paul's bravery brought a glow of
pride to Barbara's cheek. A new tie seemed to unite
them. While she was contending with Russian intrigue
in one part of the world, he had been contending with it
in another.</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville," she said aloud, "the marshal
informs me that I have no legal ground for arresting
you. And as I have not the authority, so neither have I
the wish to punish a soldier whose name has become
known throughout Europe."</p>

<p>While speaking, she had drawn nearer to him, and
now with a face made more beautiful by the love shining
from her eyes, she whispered, "Paul, keep my secret.
Come and see me at the palace. Immediately."</p>

<p>Paul's eyes assured her of his ready acquiescence. The
princess turned to depart.</p>

<p>"One moment, your Highness," said Paul, humbly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
kneeling. "If I, the principal in this duel, am innocent,
how can Trevisa, my second, be guilty?"</p>

<p>"The cases are not the same," replied the princess.
"Still," she added with a smile that brought back hope
to the heart of the ex-secretary, "still my decision may
not be irrevocable."</p>

<p>Taking the proffered arm of Marshal Zabern, the princess
returned to her droshky. The cavalcade then set in
motion and vanished almost as mysteriously as it had
appeared; and Paul was left standing there, with the
overwhelming revelation that Barbara's love towards
him was unchanged.
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER VI<br /><br />
KATINA THE PATRIOT</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>AS Paul and Trevisa emerged from the woodland
and turned upon the highroad, there drew near a
cloaked figure with steel scabbard clinking
against spurs.</p>

<p>"Marshal Zabern!" exclaimed the ex-secretary.
"How? Are you not escorting the princess to Slavowitz?"</p>

<p>"I have a little matter to despatch at the hostelry called
'Sobieski's Rest.' Her Highness has therefore condescended
to relieve me from escort-duty."</p>

<p>"Your way is our way, for at that inn we left our
troika. Marshal Zabern," continued Trevisa, presenting
Paul, "my friend&mdash;need I mention his name?&mdash;Captain
Paul Woodville."</p>

<p>"No man whose friendship I desire more," said Zabern,
raising his plumed helmet.</p>

<p>He had taken a liking for Paul,&mdash;the liking of a brave
soldier for a compeer.</p>

<p>"I have always esteemed Englishmen," continued
Zabern, "since the day I ran from them at Waterloo."</p>

<p>"You have fought under the great Napoleon, then?"
said Paul.</p>

<p>"For a brief space. As a lad of eighteen I took part in
the Moscow campaign. When Napoleon sounded the
tocsin of war against Russia, who joined him with more
enthusiasm than the Poles, eager to avenge their country's
wrongs? Did not his emissary, the Abbé de Pradt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
promise at Warsaw that his imperial master had determined
to expel the Muscovites from Europe, and to
replace them with Poles? Trusting to these words, sixty
thousand of us marched with the Grand Army upon
Moscow. Heavens! shall I ever forget the fierce thrill
of joy that pervaded our ranks as we drew rein and gazed
upon the golden spires and domes of the city of the Great
Enemy, flashing on the far-off horizon. Yes," continued
Zabern, his eye kindling at the recollection, "yes, we took
their holy city, so-called, and planted the Polish eagles
upon the ramparts of the Kremlin, as our fathers had
done before us in the glorious days of old."</p>

<p>"And it has been the dream of the marshal's life,"
smiled Trevisa, "to renew that experience."</p>

<p>"That experience, but not <i>this</i>!"</p>

<p>And here the speaker pushed back the sleeve of his
right arm, and Paul perceived what he had not noticed
before, namely, that Zabern was minus a hand.</p>

<p>"You know the sequel," continued the marshal. "We
were compelled to retire, defeated not by superiority in
valor, but by famine and the rigor of a Russian winter.
And, my God! what a winter that was!" continued Zabern,
shivering as if he still felt the effects of the cold.
"The frost was so intense that it penetrated flesh, sinew,
and bone, rendering the limbs as white and brittle as
alabaster. In repelling an attack of Cossacks I aimed a
sabre-stroke at a fellow's head, feeling in the next moment
a curious sensation at the wrist; and there, lying
before me upon the snow, and still grasping the sabre-hilt,
was my own hand. It had dropped off at the joint,
as you see."</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried Trevisa.</p>

<p>"Eh? well, yes, it was rather awkward, for it was the
right hand, you see, and never having accustomed myself
to employ the left I was rendered completely useless for
the rest of the campaign. However, I have repaired the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
deficiency, and here is a hand as good as the lost one,"
continued Zabern, holding up his left hand. "So ended
my first experience with the Russians."</p>

<p>"You fought them again?" inquired Paul.</p>

<p>"At many times and in many places. I have aided
Georgians in the Caucasus, and Turks on the Danube.
And when secret tidings came to me that Poland was preparing
to vindicate its freedom against the tyranny of the
viceroy Constantine, brother of the present Czar, I hastened
to take part in the enterprise. Her Highness's
father, Prince Thaddeus, would not permit Czernova to
be drawn into the movement; selfishly, as we then
thought; wisely, as we now perceive.</p>

<p>"The rising began at Warsaw in a conspiracy to seize
the person of the Grand Duke Constantine. I was one of
the eighteen appointed for the purpose. At nightfall we
set off for the palace, slew the guards, and penetrated to
the vice-regal bedchamber. But we were just a few seconds
too late. Roused from sleep by the clash of arms,
and the shouting, Constantine had sprung from the bed,
thrown a cloak over himself, and fled by a secret staircase
communicating with the palace gardens."</p>

<p>"The insurrection failed?"</p>

<p>"For a year we offered a gallant resistance to all the
might of Russia. But what can valor effect against numbers?
We gained victories, and those great ones; but if
we slew ten thousand of the enemy on one day, there was
a second ten thousand to replace them on the morrow.
We had no such reserves to fall back upon. And then,
too, the damned Russians brought the cholera with them,
an ally that proved far more fatal than their arms; though,
the saints be praised! it carried off the tyrant Constantine.
On the taking of Warsaw I became one of a band
of prisoners condemned to march in chains four thousand
miles over the winter snow to Siberia."</p>

<p>"And you escaped?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"After five years, and have found asylum in Czernova.
And here I am to-day, fifty-three years of age, and good
for a deal more mischief yet," continued Zabern with a
grim twinkle in his eye. "To see me holding the post of
minister is gall and wormwood to the Russians; they have
required my extradition, but the princess has resolutely
refused to grant it."</p>

<p>Such in brief was the history of Zabern, and though
his attempts to win freedom for his country were deserving
of sympathy, Paul could not avoid a feeling of regret
that Barbara should have admitted to her ministry such a
firebrand as this patriot, whose undoubted aim was to
utilize the resources of Czernova against Russia, should a
favorable opportunity occur.</p>

<p>"By the way, Trevisa," said the marshal, turning to
the ex-secretary, "you must not let the princess's frown
diminish your interest in the cipher letter found upon the
spy Russakoff. Read me that riddle, and I will undertake
to restore you to favor."</p>

<p>"I fear my restoration will not come upon those terms,"
said Trevisa, lugubriously. "The cipher is a most baffling
one. I should have a clue if you could name the
writer."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"The first step in a problem of this sort is to know in
what language the document is written; and of this I am
ignorant. How, then, can I proceed? The principles of
decipherment which an expert applies to one language
fail when applied to another. But if I learn who the
author is, and I discover that he knows, say, Russian only,
the inference is that the document is written in that language;
I apply certain principles deduced from a study
of Russian, and the result is decipherment. The knowledge
that the writer is versed in several languages would,
of course, enhance the difficulty; but still, with time and
patience success is certain. Have you no clue as to the
writer?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>Zabern was silent. He glanced at Paul as if wishing
him away.</p>

<p>"I will step aside for a moment," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Trevisa. "Marshal, you can trust
my friend Captain Woodville as surely as myself."</p>

<p>"Then on my honor as a soldier I believe that the Duke
of Bora was either the author or the recipient of that
letter."</p>

<p>"The duke!" cried Trevisa in amazement. "You
accuse the duke of holding a treasonable correspondence
with Russia? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Why impossible?"</p>

<p>"Is it reasonable that he should seek to subvert the
throne of a princess to whom he is affianced?"</p>

<p>Zabern smiled cynically.</p>

<p>"The duke has come to count it no great prize to have
but a moiety of the throne, and to be mated withal to a
little lady who will take no bidding from him, and therein
small blame to her. The princess hath ever been cold to
the match, and therefore the duke, doubtful of her affection,
has begun to play a double part, or in other words, to
intrigue with Russia. 'Dispense with the princess, and
reign alone under the suzerainty of the Czar'&mdash;that is
his secret ambition. What other conclusion can I come to,
when I see him tampering with the Czernovese army?
On frivolous pretexts he has removed Polish officers from
their command, replacing them by such Muscovites as
have at heart the interests of the Czar rather than those of
the princess. Moreover, we have certain proof that our
cabinet contains a member who reveals to Russia our
secret counsels. You know the cabinet well, Trevisa;
tell me whom to suspect. Radzivil?&mdash;absurd! Ravenna?
What hath a Roman cardinal to gain by inviting
the head of the Greek Church to take possession of Czernova?
Dorislas? Then let me fall on my sword's
point, so certain am I of never again finding faith among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
men, if he be traitor. Mosco, the Greek Arch-pastor?
Hum! his zeal on behalf of the princess has perhaps diminished
somewhat since her conversion to Catholicism,
but he is more dullard than villain. Polonaski the Justiciary?
I'll mention no more. When we would discover
the author of a crime, we naturally fix our suspicions
upon the man who has most to gain by the deed. Judged
by this test the duke, and the duke alone, is the traitor.
<i>Delendus est Bora!</i> Czernova will never be sound till he
be gone."</p>

<p>There was no reply from Trevisa, who seemed to be
lost in deep thought. Then suddenly his eyes lightened
as with some new and surprising idea.</p>

<p>"Marshal," said he emphatically, "you shall have a
translation of that letter in the morning."</p>

<p>It took a good deal to surprise the marshal; nevertheless
on the present occasion he was quite confounded.</p>

<p>"How? What?" he cried. "You claim to have discovered
the key to the cipher, when but a minute ago you
professed ignorance of the very language in which the
letter is written?"</p>

<p>"The language is Greek," murmured Trevisa, almost
breathless at his discovery, and talking more to himself
than to his companions. "Yes, yes; I comprehend it all
now. The most ingenious cipher ever devised. Nothing
but an accident could have revealed the key. You are
quite correct, marshal, in your estimate of the duke's
character. He is a traitor, and that letter will prove it.
I will work at it to-night, and to-morrow morning you
shall have the result."</p>

<p>"Good!" replied Zabern, mystified, as was Paul likewise,
by the suddenness with which Trevisa had arrived
at the solution of a problem that during the past month
had baffled his wit.</p>

<p>The shades of twilight were falling as the trio drew
near to "Sobieski's Rest," an inn so called because the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
greatest of the Polish kings had once passed a night
there. It was a spacious and picturesque hostelry, composed
of a mixture of stone and timber, and shaded by
overhanging birch-trees.</p>

<p>Outside the building, and holding two horses by the
bridle, stood the trooper Nikita, Zabern's orderly, who had
been sent on ahead to await the arrival of the marshal.</p>

<p>Bidding him remain at the entrance, Zabern passed
within, and led the two Englishmen to a private apartment
wainscotted with oak and decorated with elk-antlers.</p>

<p>"Poland has never been lacking in female beauty,"
remarked the marshal to Paul, "and I am about to present
you to her fairest daughter after the princess. This
inn is kept by a friend of mine,&mdash;an old companion-in-arms,&mdash;Boris
Ludovski by name, once a wealthy noble of
Warsaw. His zeal in the cause of Polish liberty has reduced
him to the position of inn-keeper. Freedom often
treats her children hardly. As this is a frontier-inn, and
on the main road to Warsaw, it often happens that suspicious
characters call here for a drink, and Boris's pretty
daughter, Katina, being a maiden who keeps her eyes
open, is sometimes enabled to supply the police of Slavowitz
with valuable information. Hence my reason for
coming here at this present moment, for it is just possible
that she can tell me something of the spy Russakoff who
escaped from the Citadel to-day. Ah! here is Katina
herself."</p>

<p>The person who had entered was a typical Polish belle
with fine dark hair and flashing eyes. Trevisa whispered
to Paul that she was a descendant of Mazeppa, the famous
hetman of the Ukraine; and certainly there was that in
her elastic step, her fearless glance, her whole air that
marked Katina Ludovska as a true daughter of the
steppes, wild and untamable.</p>

<p>She was handsomely attired. Over a snow-white
chemisette she wore a close-fitting dark red jacket, laced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
in front from neckband to waist; a polished black leather
belt gleaming with silver bosses; and a dark blue skirt,
prettily braided with silver,&mdash;a skirt which, swelling
out below the waist, imparted a charming outline to her
figure. A pair of red leather shoes completed her outward
costume.</p>

<p>The marshal saluted her in Polish fashion by kissing
her hand, while she in turn pressed her lips to his forehead.
She gave the like greeting to Trevisa, who appeared
to be well known to her, and this done she cast a
glance of inquiry at the third comer.</p>

<p>"Paul?" she said with a pretty pout, after the marshal
had introduced him, "why do you bear the same name
as a Czar?"</p>

<p>"There is little of the Czar in him, however," remarked
Zabern. "Why, Katina, Captain Woodville has fought
against Russians in Asia."</p>

<p>"May he live to fight against them in Europe," said
Katina; and Paul could see that she was a maiden quivering
with patriotism to her finger-tips.</p>

<p>"Amen to that!" replied Zabern; and in an exultant
tone he continued, "but I have tidings for you, Katina,
tidings. The princess and the duke are riven asunder.
She has plucked him from the cabinet, from the command
of the army, and better still from her heart. Never shall
Bora put wedding-crown upon the brow of the princess.
He is of less account now in her eyes than the driven leaf
in the wind-swept wood."</p>

<p>Katina expressed her delight by dancing the first steps
of a graceful mazurka.</p>

<p>"Joy!" she cried. "I never liked that our fair princess
should bide on bolster with a Russ, and a Russ who
hath sworn at the drink to harness the Polish nobles to
the yoke and with them plough his fields. And so John
the Strong has fallen! How came it to pass?"</p>

<p>The marshal explained; and when Katina learned that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Paul had been the direct cause of the duke's downfall she
no longer withheld the kiss of friendship.</p>

<p>"You have wrought a good deed for Czernova, and I
love you for it," she cried impulsively, pressing her lips
to his forehead, not once, but twice. And though Katina
was not the princess, Paul was fain to confess that she
made a charming substitute.</p>

<p>"Shades of Kosciusko! what have we here?" cried
Zabern, walking towards a smoke-begrimed oil-painting
that hung upon one of the walls. "Fie, Katina! you, a
daughter of Poland, to keep a portrait of the Czar&mdash;that
Czar too who crushed us at Warsaw sixteen years ago,
the haughty, frowning Nicholas!"</p>

<p>"Ah! you Muscovite wolf!" cried Katina, shaking
her fist at the picture. "Lying Czar, that broke his coronation-oath
to Poland. Where is the constitution you
promised us? Grandson of an empress who was a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>Katina suppressed the word that rose to her lips, for it
was not a pretty epithet, though justly applicable to the
moral character of Catherine II.</p>

<p>"Hold! let the grandmother be!" interposed Zabern.
"Remember that Catherine gave to Czernova its Charter
of liberty."</p>

<p>"I warrant the old beldam was drunk when she
granted it."</p>

<p>"No matter, drunk or sober, it <i>was</i> granted. And to-day
we have that Charter, signed and sealed, locked in an
iron chest, secured in a stone chamber, and guarded by
soldiers night and day."</p>

<p>"And to think," said Katina, still on the subject
of the portrait, and turning to the two Englishmen as
she spoke, "to think that your sweet, youthful queen
Victoria should allow herself to be embraced and kissed
by this Muscovite bear when he parted from her at
Windsor!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>"It wouldn't do to attempt the same with our princess,&mdash;eh,
Katina?"</p>

<p>"No. Mild and gracious as she naturally is, I warrant
she would flash a dagger before his eyes."</p>

<p>"Since you hate the original so," asked Paul, "why
display his portrait?"</p>

<p>"To draw Russian customers, who like to have the face
of their little father looking down upon them at the drink.
Why should I not levy tribute from the enemy? Their
kopeks all go to the good cause. The last visitors to
this room were Muscovites; hence that side of the canvas.
When Polish patriots come I have a fairer face to show.
Behold!"</p>

<p>She turned the picture, and lo! on the back of the
canvas was a well-executed portrait of the regnant Princess
of Czernova.</p>

<p>"My pretty Janus!" laughed Zabern. "You should
have been born a man. What a statesman you would
have made! Come, I know your love for the princess.
I'll reveal a truth that will make you love her still more.
You have always believed her to be of the Greek Church;
learn, now, that she is a Catholic."</p>

<p>"Are you not betraying a state secret?" smiled Trevisa.</p>

<p>"No; for the truth is known to all Czernova, or will be
in a few hours. That damnable Russophile journal, the
'Kolokol,' came out this afternoon with a long article
headed, 'Natalie the Apostate'&mdash;an article roundly accusing
the princess of Catholicism. Of course the charge
is true, and we can't deny it."</p>

<p>"Pity that the truth should first be proclaimed in the
columns of a slanderous journal rather than by the princess's
ministers from their places in the Diet! How did
editor Lipski discover the secret?" asked Trevisa.</p>

<p>"How? Ask the duke," replied Zabern.</p>

<p>"There will be deep murmurings to-night in the Muscovite
faubourg."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>"Which can soon be quelled by a few rounds of grape-shot,"
commented Zabern, who, like the first Napoleon,
was a great believer in the pacificatory virtues of artillery.</p>

<p>"'The princess and Catholicism!'" cried Katina. "Let
that be our motto. What matters the defection of the
Muscovites, since the Poles will now be doubly loyal."</p>

<p>"Well said, Katina. Pass me the vodka. To the resurrection
of Poland!" continued Zabern, raising his glass.
"Ah! Katina, when your father Boris and myself first
drew breath, we had a motherland. Stanislaus was reigning,
and Poland was free. To-day what is she?"</p>

<p>"A lioness in chains of whom the keeper is afraid. One
day the lioness will break from her chains, and then woe
betide the keeper!"</p>

<p>"You wonder, perhaps, at Katina's patriotism?" whispered
Zabern to Paul. "You shall see that she hath good
cause for it." And then aloud he added: "What said
Czar Nicholas after suppressing the rising of 1830?
'Russia hath a mission to fulfil.' Katina, let the two
Englishmen see how holy Russia fulfils her mission.
Give them visible proof. You know what I mean."</p>

<p>Paul, entirely ignorant of Zabern's object, wondered
why Katina should start, and why she should cast a glance
of anguish at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Do you seek to humiliate me, marshal?"</p>

<p>"No, I seek to gain another sword for Poland," said
Zabern gravely, with a significant glance at Paul.</p>

<p>The ordinary woman might very well have hesitated to
comply with the marshal's request; but Katina was no
ordinary woman. She walked a few paces off, placed the
lamp upon the table in a suitable position, and then turning
her back upon her visitors she began to unlace her
jacket, and to loosen and cast back the white linen beneath.
A startling act, truly, and yet performed with a modest
air.</p>

<p>Holding the last vesture in position by its neckband, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
said in a bitter tone: "The ignorant have sometimes
complimented me upon my beautiful figure. See with
what justice!"</p>

<p>The vesture dropped from her hand, and hung downward
from her belt, leaving her form bared to the waist.</p>

<p>The fall of that linen was a revelation!</p>

<p>A sculptor would have been charmed with the fair
rounded throat and white neck. But the torso below! It
was no wonder that Katina made haste to hide it from
view again.</p>

<p>"Her bosom is the same," whispered Zabern, "or
rather it is destroyed. The long lash of the knout coils
completely round its victim, you know."</p>

<p>"The knout!" cried Paul, thrilling with horror at the
thought that such a dreadful instrument should have been
applied to the delicate skin of a youthful maiden.</p>

<p>If it had been Zabern's object to win Paul over to the
Polish cause he had succeeded. The most eloquent oration
against Russian despotism could not have wrought
such effect upon him as the bared back of this silent
maiden.</p>

<p>"As there is a God in heaven, the nation that does such
things must perish. What had she done to be treated
thus?"</p>

<p>While Katina was silently replacing her garments the
marshal proceeded to whisper her story.</p>

<p>"Katina's parents, who lived at Warsaw, gave shelter
to a Polish patriot, and for this offence the whole Ludovski
family were banished to the Uralian mines.</p>

<p>"Here Katina's beauty attracted the desires of the
governor, Feodor Orloff; and, sending for her he offered
to restore her family to liberty, upon what conditions
you can guess, when I tell you that Katina's reply was a
fierce blow from her open palm.</p>

<p>"The morrow happened to be the emperor's birthday,
and Orloff with fiendish malice aforethought had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Polish exiles paraded before him, told them that they
would be free from work that day, and in return for this
boon required that they should cry 'God save the Czar,'
Some refused, and among them the spirited Katina. Here
was Orloff's opportunity. For disloyalty to the emperor,
Katina was condemned to receive fifteen strokes of the
knout.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a knouting? No? Well, I trust
you never will, for it is not a pleasant sight, even though
your nerves be of iron. I have been compelled to witness
many such scourgings in Siberia, and I tell you that
though Dante in his 'Inferno' has imagined many and
various tortures for the damned, none of them are equal
to the agony that an expert executioner can elicit with a
few strokes of the knout.</p>

<p>"You must know that the victim, his wrist and ankles
clasped by iron rings, is fixed to a sort of framework set
erect in the ground&mdash;fixed in such a manner that he can
make no movement, literally stretched as an eel's skin is
stretched to dry.</p>

<p>"About twenty paces off stands the executioner, with
sleeves tucked up, for nothing must embarrass the freedom
of his movements. He holds in both hands the instrument
of punishment&mdash;the knout. This is a thong of
thick leather, cut triangularly, an inch in breadth, from
nine to twelve feet long, and tapering to a point; this
tapering end is fixed to a little wooden shaft about two
feet in length.</p>

<p>"At the given signal the executioner advances, his body
bent, and dragging the long lash between his legs. When
he has arrived within three or four paces of his victim, he
suddenly raises the knout above his head: the thong flies
into the air, whistles, descends and clasps the naked torso
of the sufferer as with a circle of iron. Notwithstanding
his state of tension the victim bounds as if under a powerful
shock of galvanism, at the same time uttering a shriek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
that, once heard, can never be forgotten. My God!
Even now I often start from sleep with such a cry ringing
in my ears.</p>

<p>"In drawing back the lash again the executioner has a
way of pulling it along the edges of the opened flesh in
such a manner as to widen and deepen the wound it has
made.</p>

<p>"He retraces his steps and begins again the same man&oelig;uvre
as many times as the victim is condemned to suffer
blows. When the thong envelops the body with its folds
the flesh and the muscles are literally cut into segments,
as with a razor. The victim, crimson with blood, foams
at the mouth and writhes in fearful agonies.</p>

<p>"And so our pretty Katina, nude to the waist&mdash;but
enough; you have imagination, you can picture the
scene."</p>

<p>Katina herself with saddened air had now drawn near
again, in her dark eyes a fire that spoke of a desire for
vengeance.</p>

<p>"Katina," said Paul, impulsively, "if this Feodor
Orloff be still living tell me where he may be found; I
will seek him out, challenge, and slay him."</p>

<p>"No, brave Englishman, no. That vengeance belongs
to me. No one must rob me of my due. And," she added
with clenched hand and stern look, "the day is coming.
Fate is drawing Count Orloff near to Czernova."</p>

<p>"True!" replied Zabern. "He has lately been appointed
governor-general of Warsaw, a province bordering
on our own."</p>

<p>"And his appointment bodes no good to Czernova,"
remarked Katina. "Marshal, I have a strange tale for
your ears,&mdash;a tale I have been waiting the opportunity to
relate. What will you say when I tell you that I have
this very day seen the executioner who knouted me,&mdash;the
minion of Orloff?"</p>

<p>"You are dreaming, Katina."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>"No, marshal, no. It is difficult, I am aware, for the
knouted person to see his executioner, but nevertheless I
contrived to see the face of mine, and what is more I have
seen it again to-day&mdash;this afternoon&mdash;in the room where
we now are. I could not mistake those furtive reddish
eyes, that horse-shoe mark on the cheek&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heavens! Katina, what are you saying?" interrupted
Zabern, with more excitement than he usually displayed.
"That a man with a horse-shoe mark on his cheek has
been here this afternoon? Had the fellow a blue caftan,
a red beard, a trick of gnawing his finger-nails&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You describe the very man, marshal."</p>

<p>"Russakoff, as I live! Your old executioner and my
spy one and the same person! Can it be?&mdash;And he was
here this afternoon? At what hour did he call?"</p>

<p>"About four o'clock."</p>

<p>"That would be five hours ago," observed Zabern,
referring to his watch. "He must have made his way
here directly after escaping from the Citadel, bent on
crossing the frontier, doubtless. Let me have your story,
Katina. Would that you had told it me earlier!"</p>

<p>"This afternoon," Katina began, "I was returning
from a walk, and on entering the inn met my sister,
Juliska, carrying a tray with two glasses. 'Katina,' she
said, 'we have two very suspicious-looking visitors.
They have asked for a private apartment and some vodka.
Carry this in, and tell me what you think of them.' I took
the tray from her hand and walked into this room.</p>

<p>"Two men were sitting here. One had his back to me;
facing him was the other whom I recognized in a moment
as the man who had knouted me at Orenburg. Why I
did not drop the tray in surprise, how I contrived to check
my cry, I do not know; I somehow succeeded in repressing
my emotion."</p>

<p>"Did not the villain himself recognize you?"</p>

<p>"He did not look at me when I entered; his attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
seemed wholly absorbed by the words of his companion.
While placing the vodka on the table I kept my head
averted from my old enemy, and took a glance at the other
man, but I failed to see his face clearly, for his hat was
pulled low over his brows, and the collar of his cloak was
drawn up almost to his mouth. It was this peculiarity
that had excited Juliska's suspicions. The brief glance I
had of him disposes me to the belief that he was a man far
higher in the social scale than the other."</p>

<p>"'Happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast
served us,'" murmured Zabern. "Why did you not call
upon your father and brothers to seize the knouter, and
give him a taste of what he had made you suffer?"</p>

<p>"That idea, marshal, was running through my head.
After placing the vodka upon the table I withdrew silently
and quickly; and while in the act of closing the door I
caught a remark uttered by the man who had knouted
me."</p>

<p>"Call him Russakoff; 't will be simpler," suggested
Zabern.</p>

<p>"Russakoff, then&mdash;to please you. 'You will not persuade
me to return to Slavowitz,' he was saying. 'I have
no wish to fall into Zabern's hands again.' My excitement
increased, marshal, at this mention of your name.
I resolved to try to learn something of their business
before giving orders for their seizure; and, accordingly,
since they were seated by the open window, beneath which
is an immense leafy laurel, I stole outside and put myself
in concealment there in the hope of overhearing their
words.</p>

<p>"They conversed in low tones, but now and again,
when their voices were raised in evident anger, I caught a
few remarks.</p>

<p>"'I wonder that Orloff should employ a fool like you,'
said Russakoff's companion; 'one unable to keep from
the vodka, who takes part in a tavern brawl, and gets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
himself arrested while carrying an important political
document! If that letter should be deciphered by the princess's
secretary, it will lead to the frustration of a scheme
by which the Czar hopes to gain possession of Czernova,
legally and quietly, without the employment of military
force.'"</p>

<p>"What?" cried Zabern. "Let me hear that again,
Katina."</p>

<p>Katina repeated her words.</p>

<p>"Russia to obtain Czernova legally, without employing
force! In the devil's name&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>Beneath their overhanging brows Zabern's gray eyes
gleamed like polished cannon deep-set within embrasures.</p>

<p>Paul was equally startled by Katina's words. Was it
possible that the Russian bureaucrats had discovered that
the regnant princess was not the real Natalie Lilieska? If
they could prove that she had no title to rule, the throne
would devolve upon the Duke of Bora, who might of his
own free will resign his rights to the Czar Nicholas as the
next in succession.</p>

<p>Was this what Russakoff's companion meant when he
spoke of a quiet and legal way of obtaining possession
of Czernova?</p>

<p>Fear seized Paul as he began to realize that the same
result could be attained by assassination. Over the body
of Barbara, slain by the dagger of some Muscovite fanatic,
the Czar might step to the throne of Czernova!
Did the cipher-despatch relate to some such terrible plot?</p>

<p>"Proceed, Katina. Heard you aught else?"</p>

<p>"After some more whispering Russakoff raised his
voice. 'No; it's a risky business. Besides, what are
four hundred roubles?'&mdash;'We will double the sum if
the work be done within twelve hours,' replied the other.</p>

<p>"It was quite clear to me that some mischief was
afoot, and, though desirous of learning more, I feared
that if I waited longer they might rise and depart before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
I should be able to have them seized. I stole off, summoned
my two brothers, but, on entering the room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fire and brimstone! the birds had flown."</p>

<p>"You are not more vexed than I was, marshal."</p>

<p>"Were their glasses empty?"</p>

<p>"No; full."</p>

<p>"Ah! they had caught sight of you in hiding. A
pity you delayed the seizure! You gave chase, I
presume?"</p>

<p>"Marshal, we&mdash;my father, brothers, Juliska, the servants,
myself&mdash;ran here and there; we looked in all
directions, but failed to discover a trace of them. My
father deeming the matter of great importance, immediately
sent Juliska to Slavowitz to apprise you of it; but
evidently you have not seen her."</p>

<p>"I must have left Slavowitz before she arrived. Katina,
you have once more proved yourself a valuable
auxiliary to the princess's government. So this spy is
employed by one Orloff; and since he was certainly at
one time in the service of Count Feodor Orloff, and inasmuch
as he comes from Warsaw, and is evidently the
agent of one high in authority there, we doubtless do the
new governor-general no wrong in crediting him with
a plot to overturn the independence of Czernova. If so,
there will be a double pleasure in defeating him&mdash;eh,
Katina? It will please him to learn that it was Ludovski's
daughter that foiled his schemes, for I will take care that
he shall learn it. My suspicions have become certainties.
The duke and Orloff are leagued together for the
hurt of the princess, and Russakoff is their intermediary.
What is the 'risky business' that Russakoff deems ill-paid
by a sum of four hundred roubles, sum to be doubled
if the work be done within twelve hours? You are certain
those were the words, Katina?"</p>

<p>"Quite certain, marshal."</p>

<p>"And the other man&mdash;who is he, I wonder?&mdash;was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
trying to persuade Russakoff to return to the city? Has
he returned? If so, my spies shall find him ere the night
be past. Trevisa," he continued, turning to the ex-secretary,
"you see now the importance of that secret despatch,
the necessity for its immediate decipherment. No more
delay then. To Slavowitz," cried Zabern, rising abruptly.</p>

<p>Katina instantly flew off to summon the driver of the
troika in which Paul and Trevisa had made their journey
from Slavowitz. The three men proceeded to the entrance
of the inn where they found the trooper Nikita, still
holding the two horses, and seeming as if he had not
moved an inch from his previous position. Night had
fallen, and the stars were twinkling in a dark sky. The
bright light from the inn-door streamed pleasantly across
the road to the trees on the opposite side.</p>

<p>"Pardon my haste, gentlemen," observed Zabern, "but
I should do wrong to tarry longer, when there may be
rioting in the capital. The princess's conversion to Romanism
and the arrest of the Duke of Bora are matters
sufficient to set the Muscovite mind ablaze. I'll ride on
ahead; do you follow with all speed."</p>

<p>Katina reappeared at this moment, and the marshal
gallantly kissed her hand at parting. The glad light that
came into her eyes told Paul a secret.</p>

<p>"As I live," he murmured to himself, "our pretty
Katina loves Zabern."</p>

<p>The marshal swung himself into the saddle, and the
next moment with his steel scabbard swinging beneath
his cloak, he was galloping towards Slavowitz, accompanied
by his faithful orderly Nikita.</p>

<p>A minute afterwards the three-horsed car appeared at
the inn-door in charge of its istvostchik or driver.</p>

<p>"The troika is ready, my little fathers," he cried.</p>

<p>The two friends took their places in the vehicle, and
scarcely had they done so, when there passed into the
glow of light, and out again immediately, a man whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
tall cylindrical hat and black cassock proclaimed him to
be a papa or priest of the Oriental Church.</p>

<p>On perceiving this ecclesiastic the istvostchik made
the sign of the cross in Greek fashion, at the same
time quitting the troika and saying as he did so:
"Pardon me, little fathers, but I dare not drive you
to-night."</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" Paul in wonderment asked of
Katina.</p>

<p>"The poor fellow is a Muscovite," she explained with
a pitying smile, "and Muscovites deem it a bad omen to
meet a priest of their own faith when setting out upon a
journey."</p>

<p>Katina had spoken truly. All the inducements and
bribes on the part of the two friends failed to shake the
resolution of the old istvostchik.</p>

<p>"The Muscovites have a curious way of honoring their
priesthood," smiled Paul.</p>

<p>"I have a troika," said Katina, "and since I have
promised to fetch my sister Juliska home from Slavowitz
to-night, why should you not accompany me thither?"</p>

<p>Paul and Trevisa saw no reason, whatever, why they
should not accept the services of so fair a charioteer.
Katina accordingly gave an order to one of the inn-servants,
and then disappeared within the hostelry. She
returned almost immediately, looking charming in a
handsome mantle trimmed with fur. At the same moment
there was brought round from the rear of the premises
a second troika, which was certainly a much finer
vehicle than the first. It was lined with red leather, and
drawn by three spirited ponies.</p>

<p>"Here are steeds worthy of Mazeppa himself," said
Katina, offering each a sweetmeat. "The Ukraine hath
not their like."</p>

<p>She laid her cheek against the manes of all three in
turn. The ponies tossed their heads and pawed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
ground, evidently as proud of their young mistress as she
was of them.</p>

<p>"This is Natalie, and that Stephanie," she continued
indicating the two harnessed within the duga or wooden
arch. "They are named after the princess and her
mother."</p>

<p>"And the third?" inquired Paul.</p>

<p>"Oh! she is for show, and not for use; she prances
merely without drawing, and so, being useless, my
sister has, of course, called her Katina. Now if your
excellencies are ready."</p>

<p>Paul and Trevisa seated themselves in the vehicle and
since each declared that he must have Katina beside him,
that maiden was laughingly compelled to take her place
between them.</p>

<p>"Do not travel to-night, my little masters," said the
istvostchik as he watched these preparations. "Ill-fortune
will attend you."</p>

<p>Katina gave the reins a scornful shake.</p>

<p>Trevisa laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>Paul looked grave; to his mind there was something
strangely impressive in the quiet dignity of this old man
as he stood on the steps of the inn-door, his cap doffed
and his eyes raised to the star-lit sky.
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER VII<br /><br />
WHAT HAPPENED IN RUSSOGRAD</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>Though Katina was an avowed foe of all Muscovites,
she nevertheless possessed a characteristic
in common with them,&mdash;a passion for furious
driving.</p>

<p>With a stamp of her pretty red shoes, and with cries
that sounded somewhat wild on the night air, she urged
the horses to their full speed. She carried a short-handed
whip with a long leathern thong, but she used it only to
lash the air.</p>

<p>Amid the tintinnabulation of a peal of silvery bells
hung from the duga, the spirited coursers plunged forward,
as if each were holding a race with the other, Katina
handling the team with a dexterity that evoked Paul's
admiration.</p>

<p>Now where the road was broad she would spread the
galloping horses outwards like a fan; and now where its
narrowness seemed to preclude all possibility of passage,
she would draw them together till they appeared to occupy
the space of one, without delaying for a moment her
onward rush.</p>

<p>Occasionally she would rise from her seat and bend
gracefully forward over the horses in an attitude suggestive
of a Grecian charioteer, bidding the two friends
with a merry laugh to "Hold fast," and the next moment
they would be racing down a steep descent; a sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
splash, a drenching shower of spray, and ere the two
friends had time to realize that they were crossing a
stream, the ponies would be tugging the troika up the
opposite bank.</p>

<p>The marvels performed by this daughter of Mazeppa
in guiding her vehicle along the edge of a declivity, or in
avoiding some obstacle that suddenly appeared in her
path, are past all belief; and though Paul expected every
moment to see the troika fall to pieces, the rapid see-saw
motion which in some persons causes all the sensations
of <i>mal de mer</i>, was both novel and pleasant, the rush
of air producing an exhilaration of spirits that quickly
effaced from his mind the uneasy presentiment caused
by the words of the old istvostchik.</p>

<p>"At this pace we ought soon to overtake Marshal Zabern,"
remarked Paul.</p>

<p>"We are not following the same road," replied Katina.
"In journeying to Slavowitz I myself always take this
route, though it is more circuitous. I renew my patriotism
when in sight of that building."</p>

<p>She had brought the troika to a standstill, and was now
pointing to a large monastery that rose in solemn mediæval
grandeur at the distance of about a hundred yards
from the roadside.</p>

<p>"The Convent of the Transfiguration," said Katina.
"On some Czernovese monasteries you will see a crescent
beside the cross; it is a sign that the place was once
in the hands of the Turks. But the crescent gleams not
here," she continued proudly. "The pavement of the
Convent of the Transfiguration has never been trodden
by the foot of pagan or heretical foe. A strong fortress
as well as a monastery, it has often checked the march of
Muscovite and Turkish conquest."</p>

<p>A liturgical service was taking place in the convent.
The chant of the monks was plainly audible, intermingled
with the notes of the organ.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"They are supplicating for Poland," said Katina.
"They pray for nothing else. Day and night their one
cry is, 'How long, O Lord, how long?'"</p>

<p>The voices of the chanting friars produced a singular,
nay, a weird impression upon Paul. Paganini himself
could not have devised anything more awe-inspiring
and unearthly than the refrain that now rose upon the
night air.</p>

<p>"Some of the holy brethren," continued Katina, "are
men who were once in Siberian mines. And such men!
If you thought my back a pitiable sight, Captain Woodville,
what would you think if you could see some of the
dreadful forms hidden behind those walls?"</p>

<p>Her words, her looks, and above all the wild plaint
proceeding from the convent, increased Paul's eerie
sensations.</p>

<p>"Come here what hour you will of the twenty-four,
you shall never miss the chant of those monks; their
prayer never ends."</p>

<p>"A perpetual service? I have heard of such."</p>

<p>"When our fatherland was conquered in '95," continued
Katina, "the then abbot of yon convent ordained
that from that time forth the brethren should pray for
no other thing than the restoration of Poland.</p>

<p>"To this end he drew up a liturgy and divided the
whole body of the monks into three parts, directing that
each in turn should recite this liturgy, band to succeed
band without a moment's break. The convent has never
wanted for devout men to consecrate themselves to this
service.</p>

<p>"Day and night unceasingly for over fifty years their
supplication has been going up to the saints above," said
Katina. "Is it not time their prayer was answered?"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands and turned her face to the starlit
heaven,&mdash;a face made beautifully touching by its
earnestness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! Queen of heaven," she murmured, "look down
upon our country. Give us the thing we long for."</p>

<p>For a moment she stood in silent prayer, and then,
taking up the reins again, she began to urge the horses
forward, as if finding in that act a relief to her overwrought
feelings. Once more the troika skimmed along,
scarcely seeming to touch the earth, and the majestic
convent with mysterious voices faded away in the
gloom.</p>

<p>"Abbot Faustus still maintains his attitude of defiance
towards the new archbishop," said Trevisa addressing
Katina.</p>

<p>"And he will ever maintain it," she replied. "Be sure
that Ravenna, anathematize as he may, will never be permitted
to enter that convent."</p>

<p>"Your mysterious smile, fair Katina, disposes me to
believe that you know the reason of the abbot's defiance."</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> know it," asseverated Katina, "but I must not
reveal it. Ask the marshal to make you one of the
'Transfigured,' and you will understand the mystery.
Faster, faster, my little doves," she added, shaking the
whip over the heads of her team.</p>

<p>Onward flew the horses <i>ventre à terre</i>, and within an
hour of the time of setting out, there glimmered into view
the battled walls of Slavowitz, with its towers, spires, and
domes standing out in gray relief against a background
of blue sky dimly set with stars.</p>

<p>"Shall I take the Troitzka Gate?" asked Katina.</p>

<p>Trevisa nodded assent.</p>

<p>"'T will save a circuit," he said, "and will serve to
show my friend the two sides of Slavowitz. You have
seen Cracovia, the fashionable suburb," he added, addressing
Paul; "now take a view of Russograd, the
Muscovite quarter."</p>

<p>Katina accordingly drove through an arched gateway,
where, armed with a long halbert, stood a Polish sentinel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
who, at sight of Paul, saluted, mistaking him for an
officer of the Blue Legion.</p>

<p>As the troika, leaving the city gate behind, rolled forward
over the smooth wooden pavement of the main
thoroughfare known as the Troitzkoi Prospekt, it became
quickly evident that the dwellers in this quarter had become
aware both of the princess's Romanist faith and
likewise of the duke's arrest,&mdash;matters that naturally
tended to produce a state of great excitement. Indeed,
it looked as if there would be little sleep that night in
Russograd; for though the hour was late, all the denizens
of the faubourg, men and women alike, were abroad,
discussing in shrill tones and with fierce gesticulations
this latest phase of Czernovese politics. Russians, Tartars,
Cossacks, and representatives of other nationalities,
who at ordinary times were ready to cut each other's
throats, were now united by the bond of a common religion
against "Natalie the Apostate."</p>

<p>"Now the saints confound these Long-beards!" murmured
Katina, compelled to exercise great care in steering
her course. "Is it Butter-week, that they throng so?
Our short route is proving a long one."</p>

<p>Owing partly to the crowded state of the street, and
partly to the condition of the wooden pavement, which a
recent shower had rendered somewhat slippery, it was
impossible for the vehicle to proceed other than at a walking
pace, and thus the trio could not fail to overhear the
remarks made by some of the throng.</p>

<p>"I saw the duke brought in through the St. Florian
Gate," cried a woman, addressing a circle of bystanders.</p>

<p>"They knew better than to bring him in through the
Troitzka Gate," observed a man beside her, apparently
her husband. His face was disfigured by a long smear
of dried blood.</p>

<p>"He was riding with downcast eyes in the centre of a
troop," continued the woman. "And when my goodman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
cried, 'Long live our prince,' one of the troopers struck
him across the face with the flat of his sabre, bidding him
begone for a traitor. Look at the mark of the sword,"
she screamed.</p>

<p>"Yes," chimed in her husband, "and the princess herself
passed by a minute later in her droshky, and drove
off to the Palace, not looking one whit troubled by the
thought of the duke's imprisonment."</p>

<p>"Troubled, do you say?" cried his wife. "I never
saw her looking more glad than she did to-night. And
to think that a mere girl should have the power to arrest
a big handsome man like our Duke John! We want a
full-grown, bearded soldier to rule over us, and not a silly
maid."</p>

<p>"Especially a maiden under the thumb of Cardinal
Ravenna," interjected a bystander. "We all know why
she has imprisoned the duke; because he is a Greek, and
loves the Muscovites and the great White Czar."</p>

<p>"And the princess hates the Czar," cried the woman.</p>

<p>"The shoes she wears in her palace are stamped on the
sole with the portrait of our little father Nicholas, so that
she may tread his image under foot whenever she walks."</p>

<p>This little anecdote, entirely without truth, found ready
credence among the haters of the princess.</p>

<p>"She is removing the duke from his command to make
way for Zabern. And why Zabern? Because he is a
Pole, and a Catholic, and hates the Muscovites."</p>

<p>Amid these observations, and others of a like character,
the troika moved, its rate of progress gradually diminishing,
until the vehicle was finally brought to a standstill
by the immobility of the crowd in front, who either could
not, or would not, move out of the way.</p>

<p>"<i>Na pravo</i>&mdash;to the right!" cried those on the left
angrily; while just as angrily those on the right cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Na levo</i>&mdash;to the left!"</p>

<p>Unable either to advance or retire, the occupants of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
troika remained stationary, the centre of a crowd evidently
bent on mischief, a crowd composed mainly of the
lower orders,&mdash;or, to use the suggestive phrase of the
Russians themselves, the "Tshornoi Narod," or "Black
People."</p>

<p>Russograd was at no time a safe place for the adherents
of the princess; but in the present political crisis
the sight of one wearing, as they supposed, the uniform
of her <i>corps du garde</i> raised the fanaticism of the Muscovite
mob to a dangerous pitch. The three friends were
ill prepared for repelling an attack. Paul was armed with
his sabre only; Katina had her savage-looking whip;
Trevisa was without weapon of any kind.</p>

<p>Paul's chief fear was for Katina; but the maiden who
had bravely endured the knout did not seem at all disconcerted
by the circle of scowling faces.</p>

<p>"My little mother, step aside there," she cried, toying
with her whip, and gently endeavoring to urge the
horses forward. "Now, old soldier, have a care."</p>

<p>"Have a care yourself," exclaimed a harsh voice in
front,&mdash;the voice of a red-bearded individual in a blue
caftan. "Would you ride over me?" he added fiercely,
grasping the bridle of one of the horses.</p>

<p>His was a voice which Katina had previously heard
that same day in the parlor of her own inn. Springing
immediately to her feet, she looked fearlessly around.</p>

<p>"In the name of the princess," she cried, "I call upon
all loyal citizens of Russograd to arrest that man and to
convey him to the Citadel, for he is an escaped prisoner."</p>

<p>"The more welcome for that!" said the man with the
bloody smear.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Czar," cried the spy, "I call upon
all loyal citizens of Russograd to arrest that woman, and
to convey her to Orenburg, for she is an escaped prisoner,
a fugitive from Russian justice. What?" he continued,
advancing into the ring of space around the troika, "do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
you not know Katina Ludovska, the Polish harlot with
whom Zabern takes his pleasures?"</p>

<p>Quivering with indignation, Katina leaped from the
troika, bent on chastising the insulter. One lash from the
thong of her whip would have laid open his cheek as
effectually as a sabre-stroke; but ere she could carry out
her purpose, the more prudent Paul had laid hand upon
her belt and swung her lightly back again.</p>

<p>"And do you not recognize this fellow?" continued
Russakoff, pointing to Trevisa. "He is the princess's
paramour; private secretary is the name used in court
circles."</p>

<p>A coarse laugh greeted these words.</p>

<p>"The princess will never marry the duke. Why?
Because the secretary has poisoned her mind against
him."</p>

<p>The mob grew more menacing in their attitude.</p>

<p>Katina laughed defiantly.</p>

<p>Trevisa glanced around, wondering what had become
of the night watch appointed to patrol the streets of
Russograd.</p>

<p>Paul, casting about for a way of escape, observed that
the crowd facing the horses was but a few ranks deep.
If Trevisa and he put on a bold front, while Katina plied
her whip vigorously, there was a possibility of breaking
through the hostile circle. He whispered this idea to the
two, who both nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Be it known to all that the princess has arrested our
duke for duelling. And here," continued Russakoff,
pointing to Paul, "is the man that fought with him.
Before St. Nicholas I speak the truth. I lie not," he
added, taking out one of those sacred icons which the
Russian usually carries with him, and kissing it as he
spoke. "The princess imprisons the duke; she lets this
man go free. Men of Russograd, is this justice?"</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried the mob.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>It was impossible to rescue their beloved duke from
the grim Citadel with its massive walls loop-holed with
artillery; it was impossible to do hurt to "Natalie the
Apostate" in her strong palace, which the foresight of
the ministers had surrounded with a military cordon.
But here were persons almost as obnoxious as the princess
herself, and a hurricane of yells arose from all sides,
the women exhibiting more fury than the men.</p>

<p>"Down with the Jesuits!"</p>

<p>"Drag them from the car!"</p>

<p>"Tear them limb from limb!"</p>

<p>"Hurl their bloody heads through the princess's
windows!"</p>

<p>As the crowd surged madly forward, Paul sprang to
his feet, sabre in hand.</p>

<p>"Now, Katina, now! Ah! the cowards!" he muttered
in an agony of rage, as a stone flung by one of the mob
caught her on the temple.</p>

<p>Their escape seemed a doubtful matter. On all sides
men, and women too, were attempting to clamber into
the troika, and dealing blows with fists, sticks, and knives.
They yapped and snarled like so many dogs as they were
hurled off again by the sturdy Englishmen, Paul standing
on the left side and using the flat of his sabre, Trevisa
on the right dependent merely upon the weapons
supplied by nature, to wit, his fists.</p>

<p>While this contest was being waged Katina, though
dizzy from the effects of the stone, bent backwards, and
with a strength of wrist marvellous in a slender maiden,
she pulled the horses so far back on their haunches as to
cause their front hoofs to rise and describe circles in the
air. Poised thus she lashed them with a savagery justified
only by the occasion, though even in that moment of
peril it went to her heart to ill-treat her favorites; and
then, with a warning shout, she launched the maddened
steeds pell-mell upon the crowd in front, endeavoring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
also to clear the way by striking out to right and left
with her reddened whip.</p>

<p>The crowd facing the troika divided like water cleft
by the hand, and the vehicle flew forward with nothing
to oppose it. A double line of faces seemed to be rushing
by; oaths and cries; a jolt, occasioned by the troika
bounding over a prostrate body; another, more violent,
which left a sickening sensation in the mouth; and the
moment afterwards the vehicle, with its bells wildly
jangling, was clear of the press and racing down the
Troitzkoi Prospekt, the very embodiment of the wind,
followed by the yells of the baffled crowd.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Katina!" cried Paul. "You are the princess
of charioteers. A narrow shave, that&mdash;eh Noel?"</p>

<p>But, on turning to his companion, Paul gave a cry of
horror. Trevisa lay helplessly on the seat of the troika,
his face as white as china, his teeth set in agony, in his
eyes an awful look.</p>

<p>Paul's cry drew Katina's attention to Trevisa. She
immediately pulled up the horses.</p>

<p>"Mary, mother of angels!" she cried in a tone of
anguish. "He has been stabbed; stabbed in the side!"</p>

<p>And all the womanhood of her nature asserting itself,
she gently raised Trevisa's head, and pillowed it upon
her breast, regardless of the blood that flowed down her
dress.</p>

<p>"It was Russakoff," gasped Trevisa. "Paul," he continued,
seizing his friend's wrist. "Remember! it is the
furies, the furies of&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

<p>The act of speaking brought a rush of blood to his
mouth, and ere he could finish the strange utterance, he
was gone.</p>

<p>"Jesu Maria, he's dead!" murmured Katina in awe;
and then, her mood changing, she added with a wild
laugh, "Russakoff has earned his roubles."</p>

<p>The whole affair had happened so quickly that it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
almost impossible to believe in its reality, though the dead
form of Trevisa lay there before their eyes. For fully
half a minute Paul stared helplessly at the silent figure.
Amazement&mdash;grief&mdash;horror kept him mute and motionless;
then in a moment these feelings gave way to
the wild desire for vengeance.</p>

<p>"I'll find the assassin," he muttered, springing from
the troika, "and sabre him on the spot, though I die the
next moment for it."</p>

<p>"Would you go back among those wolves?" cried
Katina. "No, no; they will kill you too." She also
sprang from the troika, and held Paul by the wrist. "Indeed
you shall not go. Leave the assassin to Zabern.
Zabern will find him. And thank heaven, here is the
marshal!"</p>

<p>As she spoke the clatter of horse-hoofs was heard, and
turning in the direction of the sound, Paul saw a troop
of lancers approaching with Zabern at their head.</p>

<p>On nearing the troika the marshal halted his men,
saluted Paul with his sword, and then eying the crowd
that was still impotently yelling in the distance, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the fiend's name, what possessed you three to
drive through Russograd on such a night as this?"</p>

<p>His eye now caught sight of the limp appearance presented
by the silent form reclining on the troika. He
sprang from his horse with consternation written on his
face.</p>

<p>"Good God! don't say that Trevisa is dead!&mdash;Trevisa,
whom I hoped to see fighting under the banner of the
princess! Dead!" he muttered under his breath, "and
just as he was on the point of deciphering the secret
despatch, too!"</p>

<p>"He is dead," said Paul; "but this is no time for
words. The assassin is among yon crowd, and his name
is Ivan Russakoff."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>The name of the spy acted like magic upon Zabern.
He shouted some order, and in a moment more ten uhlans
trotting forward with couched lances scattered the crowd;
the object of these troopers was to secure the Troitzka
Gate, and so prevent the assassin from making his escape
by this exit. Like precautions were promptly taken with
the rest of the city gates. The remainder of his forces
Zabern skilfully disposed around the suburb of Russograd,
forming them into a cordon through which no one
could break without detection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in answer to his summons, fresh detachments
of troops arrived together with a numerous corps
of police; and to both he briefly explained the object of
the muster.</p>

<p>Zabern was well aware that, owing to the hostility with
which Polish authority was viewed in this quarter, he
would have considerable difficulty in inducing the Muscovites
to surrender the spy, whose act in slaying a
government official would be certain to enlist their sympathies.
Every dweller in Russograd would take a
pride in concealing the felon. Hence the marshal was
necessitated to make his arrangements with almost the
same care as if conducting a siege. For a few hours
Russograd was to become subject to martial law,&mdash;no
new experience for this riotous faubourg.</p>

<p>"Remember, Russakoff must be taken alive; his dead
body is of no use to me," said Zabern. "But as to the
rest, don't hesitate to shoot if there should be any resistance.
Nikita," he added, addressing his orderly, "dismount,
and assist Katina in conveying the body to the
palace. Captain Woodville, here is a horse at your
service. You will accompany us?"</p>

<p>Zabern's elaborate precautions failed to secure the person
of the spy.</p>

<p>Though all the streets of Russograd were traversed by
the military, and every individual subjected to scrutiny;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
though private dwelling and public building were explored
by keen-eyed police; and though the marshal and
his staff formed a sort of inquisitorial tribunal and interrogated
and cross-examined during the whole night, yet
no one answering to the description of Russakoff could
be found.</p>

<p>Still the marshal continued the search, encouraged by
the statement alike of the sentinels at the city gates as
of the members composing the military cordon, that the
spy had not passed outwards.</p>

<p>"So, Nariskin," he said at seven next morning, and
addressing a patriarchal, long-bearded individual who
carried himself with some show of authority, "so, Nariskin,
another government official murdered in your
ghetto! A pretty guard your night-watch keep!"</p>

<p>Nariskin, chief of the ward council that directed the
affairs of Russograd, became voluble in attesting his
grief,&mdash;his indignation,&mdash;his horror, that anything so&mdash;so&mdash;</p>

<p>"It isn't an oration that I want," said Zabern brusquely,
"but the person of Russakoff. You will assemble your
council this morning and make two announcements: first,
that henceforth Russograd shall cease to do its own policing;
that shall be my care. And, secondly, that unless
the spy is surrendered before six this evening Russograd
shall pay a fine of fifty thousand roubles."</p>

<p>Nariskin protested by Saint Vladimir that there was
not so much money in all Russograd, but the marshal
turned contemptuously away.</p>

<p>"It's useless," he said to Paul, "to search longer for
a fugitive whom a whole people are bent on concealing."</p>

<p>In gloomy mood he gave orders for the withdrawal of
the soldiery from Russograd. The military cordon, however,
was still maintained, and fresh injunctions were
issued to exercise strict supervision over every person
passing outwards.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>Paul accompanied Zabern at his request to the Vistula
Palace, and entered the apartments lately tenanted by
Trevisa.</p>

<p>Beneath a catafalque of black velvet, surrounded by
lighted tapers set in tall silver candlesticks, reposed the
body of Trevisa, his hands folded across his breast, and
holding within them lilies placed there by Katina.</p>

<p>"A sad fatality!" murmured Zabern, his somewhat
grim and hard nature touched by Trevisa's early and
mournful ending. "A sad fatality! And partly of my
own causing, too!"</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"The cipher-despatch which I entrusted to his care
has occasioned his death."</p>

<p>"You mean that he was assassinated in order to prevent
him from deciphering it?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. The duke hesitates at nothing to conceal
his treason."</p>

<p>"What proof have you of his complicity in this
affair?"</p>

<p>"Actual proof&mdash;none, else would the headsman be
now putting edge to his axe. But here are matters that
have a suspicious aspect. Not till yester-morn did the
duke learn that Russakoff was a prisoner in the Citadel,
and that Trevisa was occupied with the document found
on the spy. I did my best to keep the affair a secret, but
our premier, unthinkingly, revealed it; and, according
to him, the duke, on hearing of Russakoff's imprisonment,
looked ill at ease. Why, unless the matter concerned
him? Subsequently the duke paid a visit to the Citadel&mdash;in
his official capacity, of course; but, mark the result!
Two hours afterwards Russakoff's cell was found empty.
How? Great is the power of the rouble-note!"</p>

<p>"Why, then, send the duke to the Citadel, since the
itching palm that opened the gate for Russakoff may do
the like for Bora?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>"I have thought of that, and therefore I have appointed
some of my own troopers&mdash;fellows whom I
can trust&mdash;to be the duke's jailers. But to return to
the cipher letter," continued Zabern, in a tone of profound
dejection. "It still keeps its secret. And Trevisa
had just hit on the clue! Did he speak of the matter at
all on the way to Slavowitz? Did he give you any hint?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>But scarcely had Paul given this reply than he started,
as he suddenly recalled Trevisa's dying utterance.</p>

<p>"Marshal, I believe he tried to make a communication
to me in his last moment. His words were 'Remember
the furies!'"</p>

<p>"Passing strange! what meaning can there be in
that?"</p>

<p>The two men puzzled themselves to no purpose over
the singular saying.</p>

<p>"That cipher letter," said Zabern, reflectively, "was
perhaps the last thing in Trevisa's mind. With that sudden
intuition which sometimes belongs to the dying, he
recognized why he had been assassinated, and tried to
give you a clue. 'Remember the furies!' Humph!
here's an enigma indeed!"</p>

<p>He paced the apartment gloomily, while Paul, looking
down upon the face of his dead friend, breathed a silent
prayer for justice upon all who had part in the cruel
deed.</p>

<p>"The interpretation of that cipher letter," said Zabern,
"would enable us to defeat Russia's secret scheme
for the subversion of Czernova; but alas! where shall
we look for the interpreter?"</p>

<p>"Give me the letter," said Paul with a sudden impulse,
"and let me try my wits upon it. I am not altogether
ignorant of cryptography; it was Trevisa's favorite pursuit
when we were at college. He sought to interest me
in it, and I remember something of his methods."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>There was at first some hesitancy on the part of Zabern.
Was it wise to trust such a weighty matter to one who
owed no allegiance to the Czernovese government?</p>

<p>Paul understood the scruples of the other.</p>

<p>"You may trust me; or if not, I will take whatever
oath you wish. My sole desire is to serve your beautiful
princess."</p>

<p>Zabern's opposition vanished.</p>

<p>"You shall have the letter," he replied. "You defeated
Russia's aim in the East; now defeat her aim in
the West. But, if you are like me, you must feel the
need of a little sleep. There is a bed in the next apartment.
Sleep for an hour or two, and rise fresh for the
work."</p>

<p>Paul accepted this advice, and retired to the next
apartment.</p>

<p>"Shall I call this Fate?" he murmured, as he laid his
head on the pillow. "Without any seeking on my part
I am now beneath the same roof as Barbara."

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />
PAUL AND THE PRINCESS</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>After a brief interval of repose Paul awoke, and
had scarcely donned his uniform when a court
chamberlain, carrying a silver gilt staff, presented
himself with a message to the effect that, "The Princess
of Czernova, having learned that the illustrious defender
of Tajapore is at the present time within her palace, desires
to hold a private interview with him in the White
Saloon."</p>

<p>The chamberlain went on to say that though court
dress or military uniform was <i>de rigueur</i> in such interviews,
he had been expressly commanded to state that
on the present occasion the princess would waive all
ceremony.</p>

<p>Having no other attire with him, Paul had of necessity
to go to this momentous meeting in his uniform, and
accordingly he set off at once with the chamberlain, who
on the way ventured to remind him of the etiquette to
be observed during the approaching interview: he
must stand unless requested to sit; make no observation
of his own, but simply reply to the questions addressed
him; he must not withdraw till the princess should give
the signal, and in withdrawing he must keep his face
turned towards her.</p>

<p>All this, and much more, from Silver Staff touched
Paul with a sense of humor, when he recalled the sweet
and unrestrained intercourse at Castel Nuovo.</p>

<p>On entering the White Saloon Paul perceived Barbara
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
seated at a table, and pencil in hand, ostensibly occupied
in annotating state-papers. She wore a dainty dress of
white tulle sparkling with silver embroidery over ivory
satin.</p>

<p>She was evidently in a state of nervousness. The
pencil trembled within her fingers. She did not glance
at Paul, but kept her eyes upon the papers before her.</p>

<p>Now that the chamberlain had withdrawn, she was expecting
Paul to come forward with the greeting, "Barbara!"
Nay, if the truth must be told, she was longing
to be folded in his arms, and to hear again the passionate
language which he had addressed to her on that memorable
day of their parting.</p>

<p>But to her disappointment Paul seemed as formal as a
courtier. With his plumed helmet doffed he stood at the
distance prescribed by court etiquette waiting for her to
speak.</p>

<p>Quick to interpret his secret thought, she saw that he
recognized the existence of a wide gulf between them,
a gulf that could be crossed only from her side; if there
was to be a renewal of love it was for her to take the
initiative.</p>

<p>This attitude on his part, though studiously correct,
embarrassed her exceedingly.</p>

<p>"I little thought," she began in a low and faltering
voice, "when reading of the brave deeds of one Captain
Woodville, that the doer of them was known to me.
Captain Cressingham," she continued, reverting to the
more familiar name, "for two years I have been under the
belief that you perished in that Dalmatian earthquake."</p>

<p>"Your Highness, I have been under a similar belief
regarding yourself."</p>

<p>"Knowing, as you do," she continued, aimlessly tracing
lines on the paper before her, "that I cannot be the
real Princess Natalie, you are perhaps of opinion that I
have no right to the throne of Czernova?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>"Princess&mdash;no! I will believe anything rather than
that you are an usurper or an impostor."</p>

<p>The energy with which he spoke attested the sincerity
of his belief.</p>

<p>Now for the first time since his entrance the princess
raised her eyes, and their flash of gratitude thrilled Paul.</p>

<p>"Your faith in me is not misplaced, for I am truly the
lawful Princess of Czernova, though a strange necessity
has compelled me to assume the name of my sister
Natalie. You shall have the story anon, Captain
Cressingham," she continued, in a curiously labored
voice, as if the choice of words were a difficulty, "we
were parted in a very strange way. You will perhaps
have guessed that I was carried off by the orders of
Cardinal Ravenna, who acted, however, under the authority
of my father, Prince Thaddeus.</p>

<p>"They justified the secret abduction on the ground
that in my new sphere it would be wise, nay absolutely
necessary, to break entirely with the past. But for my
own part," added the princess softly, and with the color
mantling her cheek, "I do not see the necessity for ignoring
all former ties."</p>

<p>"Your Highness has not forgotten the days spent at
Castel Nuovo?"</p>

<p>"No, nor that day in Isola Sacra. Captain Cressingham,
I am a Lilieska, and the herald will tell you that the
motto of the House of Lilieski is '<i>Keep to troth</i>.'"</p>

<p>Paul caught his breath at these words, the significance
of which was not to be mistaken.</p>

<p>That the lovely convent maiden should care for such
an unworthy fellow as himself had been a marvel to him
two years previously; but that now, when a princess,
and capable of forming a brilliant alliance with king or
noble, she should still adhere to him, was more marvellous
still.</p>

<p>Barbara, no longer able to endure this state of tension,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
rose to her feet, and with unsteady step moved towards
Paul.</p>

<p>"When the suitor is of inferior rank," she said with a
strange catch in her voice, "court etiquette permits a
princess to make the first advance in love. Thus, then,
do I avail myself of the privilege. Paul," she continued,
taking his hands in her own, and striving to look into his
averted face, "have you forgotten your words to me on
that sunny day in the old Greek temple? Day and night
for two years I have never ceased to think of them. Yes,
though you may reproach me with the name of Bora,
your image has never been absent from my mind. Does
my new rank embarrass you? To you I am the same
Barbara now as I was then. I long to lay aside my state;
to wander again through the pine-woods of Dalmatia;
to handle an oar on the blue Adriatic as on that day when
we were so cruelly parted. Ah, heaven! how cold, how
silent you are! Why do you turn away your eyes? Paul,
look at me," she entreated wistfully.</p>

<p>Paul, knowing full well that her attachment to him
was certain to create confusion in Czernovese politics,
had come fully prepared to sacrifice his own happiness
to her interests. But this appeal on her part overcame
him. He could not resist the temptation presented by
the beautiful face so close to his own. Moved by a sudden
impulse, he clasped her passionately in his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh! this cannot be," he murmured a moment afterwards.
"It is madness."</p>

<p>"Then let me be mad," she said with a low sweet
laugh as she clung to him.</p>

<p>"You are a princess, and I am merely a military
officer."</p>

<p>"And where would the princess now be but for the
officer who found her wandering in the wild-wood?"</p>

<p>"Princess&mdash;Barbara&mdash;I love you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have been waiting for those words, Paul."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"I love you&mdash;how deeply no words of mine can tell;
but when I think of the difference in our rank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you must not think of it, Paul," she interrupted,
still within the circle of his arms, and placing her finger
with a witching air on his lip.</p>

<p>"It must be that we part. The law of Czernova forbids
our union."</p>

<p>"The Diet shall repeal that law."</p>

<p>"Your ministers, your nobility, your people will never
tolerate an untitled Englishman."</p>

<p>"I am ruler in Czernova," she answered proudly.
"No one shall dictate to me as to my choice of a consort."</p>

<p>"The Duke of Bora&mdash;what of him?" said Paul, with
difficulty pronouncing the name that had become doubly
hateful to him.</p>

<p>Barbara's eyes drooped. She hid her face on his breast.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Paul. Do not reproach me with his
name. Remember that I thought you dead. I have never
forgotten you, nor ceased to love your memory. It was
political necessity that drove me to the arms of Bora.
On my coming here from Dalmatia in the character of
Princess Natalie, I was compelled by the <i>rôle</i> I had assumed
to receive the addresses of the duke, addresses
which I at heart loathed. It had been my intention to
break with him ultimately; but of late, since I have been
threatened with deposition by Cardinal Ravenna,&mdash;yes,
deposition," she repeated with flashing eyes,&mdash;"I have
weakly thought of marrying the duke; for inasmuch as
he is the heir-apparent I should thus ensure my rank, if
not my power, as princess. But that idea is gone now;
I cast it from me forever."</p>

<p>"But why? Is not the necessity for conciliating the
duke as great to-day as yesterday?"</p>

<p>"No; for if I should have lost my crown I should
have lost the one thing I held most dear; if I lose it
now&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>She paused in her utterance.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you should lose it now&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Have I not you?" she answered with a soft pressure
of her arms. Paul would have deserved instant knouting
if he had not kissed the princess for that saying.
Then, becoming grave again he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You say the cardinal threatens you with deposition?
Why this hostility on his part?"</p>

<p>"Because I will not dance to his piping."</p>

<p>"And by adhering to me you will increase his hostility,
since with him I shall not be a <i>persona gratissima</i>."</p>

<p>"He cannot ruin me without ruining himself, and ambition
will cause him to pause ere doing that."</p>

<p>"But," said the puzzled Paul, "since you are the
daughter of Prince Thaddeus, how is it possible for him
to dethrone you, and why is it necessary that you should
personate the Princess Natalie?"</p>

<p>All this time Barbara had been standing clasped within
Paul's arms; but now, taking him by the hand, she led
him to a seat, and sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"The story of my life, as far as it was known to me,
I told you at Isola Sacra. Let me now supplement it with
details which I have since learned."</p>

<p>The following is a brief outline of Barbara's narration.</p>

<p>The late Prince Thaddeus had in youth contracted a
marriage with a young English lady named Hilda Tressilian,
who lived in the neighborhood of Warsaw. Thaddeus,
aware that his father would be averse to this match,
kept it a secret, visiting his wife at intervals. During his
absence in Czernova Hilda died suddenly, and was buried
ere the prince had time to gaze upon her lifeless form.</p>

<p>On reaching the scene of her death, Thaddeus learned
that there had been a daughter still-born, the truth being
that the infant was in reality alive, Hilda's servants having
been bribed to relate this falsehood by Pasqual Ravenna,
at that time a youthful priest of ambitious views.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
His object was to train the child in the Catholic faith,&mdash;Thaddeus
was a Greek,&mdash;and ultimately to restore her
to her rightful dignity as Princess of Czernova; the interests
of the Latin Church would be thereby advanced.
And for eighteen years Ravenna, while rising from one
ecclesiastical dignity to another, never lost sight of this
scheme; and, when he deemed the time ripe, secretly
apprised Thaddeus of the existence of Barbara.</p>

<p>That prince, pressed by political necessity, had made a
second marriage, the issue of which was an only child,
Natalie, born eighteen months after Barbara.</p>

<p>This Natalie, to whom Thaddeus had become passionately
attached, was now threatened with exclusion from
the throne by the existence of her elder half-sister.
Thaddeus, suspecting a plot on the part of the cardinal,
refused to acknowledge his resuscitated daughter; and
for a time the matter remained in abeyance.</p>

<p>Some months later the Princess Natalie, being in a
somewhat delicate state of health, was advised by the
court physician to take a tour in the countries around
the Adriatic; and Thaddeus, prompted either by fear or
by some other motive, permitted Cardinal Ravenna to
take charge of the princess. Among other places Dalmatia
was visited, and here, while at Castel Nuovo, Natalie
died.</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"She committed suicide," replied Barbara, in a whisper
of awe.</p>

<p>"You have proof of this?"</p>

<p>"I have my father's word. He had come to Dalmatia
purposely to see Natalie, and was in the neighborhood of
Castel Nuovo at the time of the tragedy. He was at once
sent for. Oh! no, there was nothing suspicious in her
death," continued Barbara, observant of the misgiving
expressed on Paul's face. "Do you think that my father,
who loved Natalie so dearly, would have connived at a
crime?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>Paul considered it not at all unlikely that Thaddeus
had been deceived by the cardinal. He refrained, however,
from expressing his doubts.</p>

<p>"In what way did she commit suicide?"</p>

<p>"She stabbed herself before any one could prevent her.
My father had the story from Lambro and Jacintha, who,
as well as the cardinal, were eye-witnesses of the deed."</p>

<p>Paul was of opinion that the cardinal who had bribed
servants to utter the falsehood of Barbara's death would
certainly employ the like expedient where his own guilt
was concerned.</p>

<p>The more Paul recalled Jacintha's air of terror and
her admission as to the mysterious oath taken on the
Holy Sacrament, the more he became convinced that
Natalie Lilieska had met her death by foul play. But
dead princesses tell no tales; and the disappearance of
the two witnesses of the deed, Lambro and Jacintha, in
the submergence of Castel Nuovo, made it extremely
improbable that the charge would ever be brought home
to the cardinal.</p>

<p>It was agreed, Barbara continued, that the scandal of
Princess Natalie's suicide must be kept secret. Her body,
sealed in a leaden coffin, was concealed beneath the flooring
of the cardinal's study at Castel Nuovo, to be removed
at a convenient opportunity to the princely vault
at Slavowitz. That opportunity never came, and the
waves of the Adriatic now flowed over the body of the
Princess Natalie.</p>

<p>It was clear that unless Thaddeus consented to recognize
the convent-maiden as his daughter, the crown of
Czernova would devolve upon one whom he personally
disliked, namely, upon Bora, though Natalie herself had
accepted the duke's addresses with pleasure.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Thaddeus, accompanied by the cardinal,
set off for the convent of the Holy Sacrament, to see the
daughter whom he had never yet seen. On his arrival,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
however, he learned with dismay that Barbara had fled
the day previously.</p>

<p>Many weeks were spent by the prince and the cardinal
in searching for her in the neighboring province and
Bosnia. They had been led into this region by a story to
the effect that she had been seen journeying in a caravan
of gypsies.</p>

<p>Disappointed in their quest, Thaddeus and Ravenna
returned to Castel Nuovo, arriving there by a singular
chance on the very day that Paul and Barbara had chosen
for their excursion to Isola Sacra. They instantly resolved
to send over a band of men for the purpose of
carrying off Barbara, and of leaving behind on the island
the dangerous young Englishman who was unknowingly
wooing a princess.</p>

<p>Their plan succeeded.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Barbara and her abductors did not pass
that night at Castel Nuovo. In the mist the boat was
carried by the current some miles lower down the coast;
and captors and captive lodged at an inn which remained
unaffected by the earthquake that had devastated the rest
of Dalmatia.</p>

<p>Barbara's passion of grief and indignation at being
torn from Paul was so violent, that the prince and the
cardinal had no other course than to promise that she
should have her own way as regarded the young Englishman.
But next morning, to the despair of Barbara,
the relief of Thaddeus, and the secret joy of Ravenna,
it was seen that Isola Sacra had disappeared beneath the
waves. It was naturally concluded that Paul had gone
down with it.</p>

<p>Grief-stricken at this ending of her love-dream, Barbara
was more disposed to return to the convent and assume
the veil of a nun than to accept the prospective
crown of Czernova; but finally she was persuaded to this
latter course by Thaddeus, who, convinced now that Barbara
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
was indeed his daughter, displayed all a father's
tenderness.</p>

<p>There would be a difficulty, however, in persuading
the Czernovese people to accept as the daughter of
their prince a maiden of whom they had never before
heard.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the church in which Thaddeus's
marriage with Hilda Tressilian had taken place
had been subsequently destroyed by fire, and with it the
documentary evidence tending to prove Barbara's identity
and legitimacy.</p>

<p>Thaddeus was thus unable to establish her relationship
to himself. The Diet might be pardoned for refusing to
take his bare word as proof. Bora, too, would loudly declare
that Barbara was a supposititious child brought forward
to deprive him of the throne.</p>

<p>In view, therefore, of her marvellous resemblance to
Natalie, it was decided by the prince and the cardinal
that Barbara should lose her own identity and should
personate the late princess.</p>

<p>This Barbara had done, and with such art and tact that
not even Bora suspected the pardonable, if not altogether
innocent man&oelig;uvre by which she had contrived to secure
her rights.</p>

<p>"With the exception of yourself," said Barbara in
conclusion, "the cardinal is the sole depositary of my
secret, for not even to Zabern, my confidant in most
things, have I revealed it. Now you understand the
power which the cardinal professes to wield over me,
and why he insolently presumes to menace me with deposition.
But he shall not succeed. Zabern is my hope.
Zabern, crafty and subtle, will find a way of defeating
the cardinal's machinations; and then," she murmured,
"and then&mdash;he shall regret his threat to dethrone the
Princess of Czernova."</p>

<p>Barbara, menaced on the one side by the cardinal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
on the other by the Czar, had not a very firm hold on her
throne, at least in Paul's judgment; and now by her attachment
to himself she was still further imperilling her
position. But he ceased to argue the matter. Any man
with those lovely arms around him might be pardoned
for shutting his eyes to the future.</p>

<p>"And so your mother was an Englishwoman?" he remarked,
seeing in that fact a possible explanation of Barbara's
pro-Anglian tastes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am half English," she replied, "and I am glad
for your sake that I am such. You have not told any
one of our prior meeting in Dalmatia?"</p>

<p>"I have kept it a secret."</p>

<p>"Let it remain such. And our love, too, must be kept
secret,&mdash;at least, for a time," she added with a sigh, for
she loved open dealing, and the hiding of her real faith,
together with the assumption of her sister's name, had
never ceased to be a source of pain.</p>

<p>"How happily we sit here," murmured Barbara, "giving
no thought to him who is lying dead! You were
with Trevisa at the time of his murder; tell me how it
happened."</p>

<p>Paul gave an account of Trevisa's death, in itself a sad
event, and one rendered still more painful to Barbara by
the thought that it had occurred so shortly after his dismissal
from his secretaryship. The sorrowful look with
which he had received her decision would never fade
from her mind. She felt his loss keenly, inasmuch as he
had been her friend as well as her amanuensis, and for
a long time she sat talking of Trevisa, of his loyalty and
his good services.</p>

<p>"I shall require a new secretary," she said. "You,
Paul, must fill Trevisa's place. Nay, forgive me for
being thus imperious. I speak as if I had the right to
your obedience. My commands are for my ministers,
not for you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_205.jpg" width="357" height="580" alt="See how well it becomes you" />
<p class="caption">
"'See how well it becomes you,' she said, drawing him gently
towards a mirror."</p>
</div>

<p>She slid playfully upon her knees before him, and put
her hands together with a demure air.</p>

<p>"May I have you for my secretary?"</p>

<p>Paul, though sometimes given to day-dreams, had certainly
never anticipated the time when a fair princess
would be kneeling at his feet. He attempted to raise
her.</p>

<p>"I will not rise till you grant my request."</p>

<p>No post could be more acceptable to Paul than this
secretaryship, since he would thus live in daily companionship
with Barbara; and, moreover, the handling of
her correspondence would initiate him into the secrets of
that fascinating subject, European diplomacy.</p>

<p>"Are you won over yet?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Who may gainsay a princess?" said Paul. "But are
you certain that my appointment will not give offence?"</p>

<p>"I reign over a divided realm. If I appoint a Pole I
shall have the Muscovites against me; if I appoint a
Muscovite I shall have the Poles against me. Therefore
I will choose my secretary from neither party."</p>

<p>"In order to unite both against you," smiled Paul.
"But I fear, Barbara, that I am ill-qualified for the post."</p>

<p>"So much the better, Paul, for it will be charming to
be your instructress," she replied, delighted that he had
accepted the appointment. "What will your sovereign
say at losing a brave soldier?"</p>

<p>"The princess is now my sovereign."</p>

<p>"Nay, not your sovereign, Paul, but your equal."</p>

<p>She rose and walked to a buhl table on which rested a
golden diadem, and returning with it, she placed it playfully
upon his head.</p>

<p>"See how well it becomes you," she said, drawing him
gently towards a mirror. "There! every inch a prince."</p>

<p>Paul smiled oddly at his reflection in the glass. He to
wear the crown of Czernova! The idea seemed too fantastic
to be entertained. For the last four and twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
hours he seemed to have been playing a <i>rôle</i> in some
romantic opera rather than to have been living in the
world of reality.</p>

<p>He put the diadem aside.</p>

<p>"It is not a crown I want, Barbara, but your own sweet
self."</p>

<p>"And you have me, Paul," she said, kissing him affectionately.
"Nothing but death shall part us. And
now," she continued, quitting his arms with reluctance,
"we must put on our masks and play our parts, for I
am about to summon the chamberlain."</p>

<p>On the appearance of Silver Staff, Barbara said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Call the marshal to our presence."</p>

<p>Zabern was soon found. On entering he glanced
keenly at Paul's face as if expecting to gain from it
some idea of the character of his long interview with
the princess; but Paul, when he chose, could be as inscrutable
as Zabern himself, and his face revealed
nothing.</p>

<p>"What news of Russakoff?" asked the princess.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, I regret to say that the spy is still
at large."</p>

<p>"The ruffians of Russograd, who slew Trevisa because
he was an Englishman and loyal to me, shall find that
they have gained little by their deed, for I herewith replace
him by an Englishman equally as loyal. Marshal,
my new secretary."</p>

<p>Zabern bowed and answered like a courtier.</p>

<p>"No appointment could give the cabinet and the Diet
greater pleasure," he replied, knowing that he was committing
himself to a doubtful statement.</p>

<p>"It is a matter in which the cabinet and the Diet have
no concern," replied Barbara with a touch of hauteur in
her voice.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, Miroslav is without, charged with a
question from the Duke of Bora."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>"What says that law-breaker?"</p>

<p>"His grace is desirous of learning from the princess
how long his detention is to last."</p>

<p>"Till the mark on my secretary's cheek shall have disappeared.
If his grace be dissatisfied with our justice, it
is open to him to appeal to the law-courts of Czernova,
whose sentence he will find considerably less lenient than
our own."</p>

<p>"Your Highness, I shall have extreme pleasure in
conveying that message to the duke."
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER IX<br /><br />
A DISPLAY OF SWORDSMANSHIP</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>On quitting the presence of the princess, Paul and
Zabern took their way through the palace gardens,
where they were met by two individuals in
uniform, whom the marshal introduced to Paul. The
more youthful of the two, who had fair hair, blue eyes,
and a comely face that seemed to indicate habitual good
humor, was Dorislas, and he held the office of Minister of
Finance. The other, a somewhat sullen-looking personage,
was Miroslav, the governor of the Citadel, "and,"
added Zabern, "the present guardian of your friend the
duke."</p>

<p>"Ah! the duke," said Dorislas to the governor. "I
marvel, Miroslav, that you have not yet been called upon
to defend your Bastille. What are your friends in Russograd
thinking of, that they so tamely submit to the duke's
imprisonment?"</p>

<p>"The marshal's placards explain the reason. At the
first attempt upon the Citadel the duke is to be brought
forth upon the battlements, and summarily shot."</p>

<p>"And therefore," commented Zabern, "it is a pity that
they do not make the attempt."</p>

<p>"Well, you know the marshal and his ways by this
time," laughed Dorislas, addressing Miroslav. "When
to-night you see a wild mob with blackened faces advancing
upon the Citadel and crying out for the release
of the duke, be sure that Zabern is somewhere among
them, disguised and playing the part of chief instigator."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>Zabern and his two friends, so it appeared, were on
their way to the <i>salle d'armes</i>, which stood in the centre
of the palace gardens. In this hall it was their
custom, provided that state affairs were not too pressing,
to fence daily. Zabern invited Paul to accompany
them.</p>

<p>"And the cipher despatch, marshal?" said the new
secretary, who, having Barbara's interests at heart, was
desirous of beginning work at once.</p>

<p>"A little fencing on your part will quicken both blood
and brain."</p>

<p>So Paul acquiesced, somewhat reluctantly, and while he
and the governor of the Citadel strode on in front, Zabern,
adopting a more tardy pace, followed in the rear conversing
with Dorislas.</p>

<p>"Marshal, what is this mystery?" asked the Finance
Minister with a significant glance in Paul's direction.
"There is a strange rumor that he and the princess were
together in Dalmatia, and that she there presented him
with a sapphire seal which had been given to her by the
duke himself. Within twelve hours of his coming to Czernova
he is challenged to a duel by Bora. Her Highness,
on hearing of the affair, flies to rescue the Englishman,
sends her affianced husband to prison, but permits the
other duellist to go free. And now you bring the amazing
news that the princess has made this Woodville her secretary.
What is the meaning of it all?"</p>

<p>"You had better ask her Highness," said Zabern dryly,
and abruptly changing the subject of conversation, he
added: "Did anything of importance take place at the
Diet last night?"</p>

<p>"What, marshal! haven't you heard?" cried Dorislas,
his face expressing the extreme of amazement.</p>

<p>"Heard? I've heard nothing. I was occupied in
searching for that assassin Russakoff till seven this morning,
since when I have been asleep. What new folly, then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
did you and the rest of the ministry perpetrate in my
absence?"</p>

<p>"You know, of course, that the first order of the evening
was the notification to the House of the princess's
change of faith. Scarcely had Radzivil risen to make his
statement, when he was interrupted by Lipski with a
sneering remark to the effect that the premier might spare
his words, for the Diet knew very well what he was going
to say, and that it would have been more becoming on the
part of the princess to have taken the House into her confidence
earlier, and not to have waited till her hand had
been forced by the article contained in his newspaper, the
'Kolokol.'"</p>

<p>"Damn his insolence! And of course the Muscovite
crew howled applause? Was Ravenna in his place?"</p>

<p>"No; the cardinal, having been the chief instrument in
the princess's conversion, shrank somewhat from facing
the wrathful Muscovites last night. He preferred the
opera-house."</p>

<p>"The coward! Would that I had been there!"</p>

<p>"What! at the opera? Yes, it was well worth visiting,
because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A truce to your fooling. What happened next?"</p>

<p>"After order had been restored&mdash;for, of course, Radzivil's
statement provoked a devil of a row&mdash;Lipski rose
and begged leave to bring in a new bill. Lamenting the
increased taxation&mdash;and you know, marshal, my Budget
is devilishly heavy this year&mdash;he introduced a measure
for the appropriation of all plate, jewels, and money belonging
to the conventual establishments throughout
Czernova, such wealth to be devoted to the needs of the
state."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Zabern. "This is nothing else but an
attack upon the princess's faith. 'I have become a Catholic,'
she avers. 'Then we will plunder your Church,' is,
in effect, the Muscovite answer."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>"True, marshal; for though the bill affects to treat
both creeds, Latin and Greek, alike, yet inasmuch as the
Latin convents are numerous and wealthy, while those of
the Greek faith are few and comparatively poor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a case of 'I'll share my kopek with you, if you'll
share your rouble with me,' eh?"</p>

<p>"Just so, marshal. Well, the bill was rushed through
its first reading&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fire and brimstone! where, then, was our party with
its splendid majority?"</p>

<p>"You forget that Rubini was here last night."</p>

<p>"Who's he?" asked Zabern, whose ignorance of
everybody and everything outside the circle of politics
was simply astounding.</p>

<p>"Come, marshal, you jest&mdash;Rubini, the Italian, the
great opera-singer."</p>

<p>"The devil fly away with him! Well?"</p>

<p>"The opera was 'The Bohemian Girl.' Rubini took
the part of Thaddeus. It would have brought the tears
to your eyes, marshal, to hear him sing, 'When the fair
land of Poland was ploughed.'"</p>

<p>"It would&mdash;to hear a damnable Italian turning the
sorrows of our fatherland into a medium for putting
rouble-notes into his pockets. But what has this to do
with the Diet?"</p>

<p>"Why, most of those on our side of the House went to
hear Rubini."</p>

<p>"Including a simpleton named Dorislas. And so
Lipski and his Muscovite crew took advantage of the
emptiness of the benches on the Right to spring this new
bill upon the Diet. But, sword of St. Michael, didn't
Radzivil send Opalinski to the opera-house to summon
away the absentee fools?"</p>

<p>"He did, with this result. When Opalinski arrived
Rubini was singing, and our whip became so entranced
that he quite forgot the errand on which he had come, till&mdash;till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
it was too late. When our fellows came trooping
back they were met with derisive laughter from the
Left."</p>

<p>"The bill had already passed its first reading?"</p>

<p>"Precisely, marshal. But that's not all. Lipski had
likewise proposed that, pending the issue of this infernal
bill, the precincts of the monasteries shall be patrolled by
the military."</p>

<p>"To prevent the monks from removing their treasures."</p>

<p>"That's the object. The Diet passed the resolution.
Radzivil, as servant of the House, was obliged to submit,
with the result that to-day there is not a monastery in
Czernova that has not bayonets moving round it."</p>

<p>"Including the Convent of the Transfiguration?"
asked Zabern.</p>

<p>"Including the Convent of the Transfiguration," answered
Dorislas.</p>

<p>Zabern muttered some oaths under his breath. Presently,
however, he broke into a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Lipski is a shrewder fellow than I gave him credit
for. A clever stroke this on his part&mdash;to prevent us
from entering that monastery by turning our own bayonets
against us."</p>

<p>"Marshal," said Dorislas, looking very grave, "if
Lipski's measure should pass&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If?" repeated Zabern disdainfully. "We will extinguish
it on the second reading."</p>

<p>"Which has been fixed for this day month. Lipski
boasts that there are surprises in store for ministers, that
there will be numerous defections on our side."</p>

<p>"'Boasts'&mdash;that is a good word, Dorislas."</p>

<p>"If that bill should become law, commissioners appointed
by the Diet will make a round of the monasteries
for the purpose of appropriating their wealth; when they
come to the Convent of the Transfiguration they will
discover&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>"What we do not wish them to discover. But as the
bill has not the remotest chance of passing, we may preserve
a serene mind on the matter."</p>

<p>Dorislas said no more. Though he was of an optimistic
nature, it was clear from his grave manner that he did
not share in Zabern's hopeful views.</p>

<p>The quartette had now reached the <i>salle d'armes</i>. Over
the portico hung the banner of the Lilieskis, which Paul
reverently saluted, for was he not honoring Barbara by
the act?</p>

<p>"That flag," said Zabern, "shall one day float over a
wider area than Czernova."</p>

<p>Passing beneath the portico, they entered a fine and
spacious hall, decorated in a style that harmonized with
its use. Along the walls were suits of armor, and pictures
of duels, tournaments, and battles. The oaken panels
were hung with swords, muskets, and pistols, so arranged
as to form devices, the favorite one being the arms of
Poland.</p>

<p>"Whenever a man is mentioned to me for promotion,"
remarked Zabern, "I always bring him here for a bout.
Ten minutes' fencing will give me a better idea of his
character than a month's investigation."</p>

<p>Paul, in view of his recent appointment, wondered
whether this remark was intended for application to
himself.</p>

<p>Among the Czernovese nobles and military officers assembled
in this hall was Count Radzivil, occupied in a
fencing-bout. In Paul's eyes the sight of the gray-headed
premier of seventy parrying and lunging with all the
ardor of a boy of seventeen was significant of much. It
seemed like a preparation for more serious work in the
near future.</p>

<p>What surprised Paul still more was a bevy of youthful
ladies fencing with each other at the far end of the hall;
and of this number was Katina, engaged in spirited contest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
with her sister Juliska, a maiden so pretty that a man
must have had the insensibility of a stone not to have
wished for a kiss.</p>

<p>All ceased their play upon the entering of Zabern, who
in a brief and graceful speech introduced Paul to the
assembly as the princess's new secretary.</p>

<p>The Englishman who had conducted the famous defence
of Tajapore could not fail to be a person of interest,&mdash;an
interest enhanced by the fact that he had not
shrunk from facing in duel the champion swordsman of
Czernova.</p>

<p>Curious glances were interchanged, both among the
ladies and likewise among the gentlemen, the meaning of
which was laughingly explained by Zabern.</p>

<p>"The truth is, Captain Woodville, we are hoping to see
a little English sword-play, in order that we may know
who is to be congratulated by the princess's intervention
yesterday,&mdash;yourself or the duke."</p>

<p>Paul modestly professed himself willing to give a display
of his skill if any one would come forward to meet
him.</p>

<p>"We have here," continued Zabern, "the six best
fencers in Czernova after the duke. If you can defeat
any of these we shall be able to form some notion as to
how he would have fared at your hands."</p>

<p>The six champions in order of merit were adjudged as
follows:&mdash;Firstly, Zabern, the Warden of the Charter;
secondly, Miroslav, the governor of the Citadel; next,
Dorislas, the Minister of Finance; then Count Radzivil,
the Premier; Brunowski, the President of the Diet, followed;
and, lastly, came Nikita the trooper.</p>

<p>"And," whispered Zabern to Paul, "if we were to
choose a seventh it would not be a man but a woman, and
she none other than Katina."</p>

<p>Paul bowed to the six men, and expressed his readiness
to meet in fencing-bout any one of the number, or all in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
turn; and taking up a fencing-blade, a blunt sabre with its
point topped by a button, he stood prepared to make good
his words.</p>

<p>Across the middle of the hall upon the oaken flooring
ran a silver line to which the opposing fencers were required
to apply their right foot; they might step over this
mark if they chose, but to recede from it by so little as an
inch was counted for defeat.</p>

<p>As Paul declined to nominate an antagonist there was
a slight argument on the part of the six as to the one who
should first respond.</p>

<p>After some hesitation Count Radzivil stepped forward.
"I fear I am too highly appraised," he modestly remarked,
"when I am placed among the seven best fencers
in Czernova."</p>

<p>All drew near to witness the contest. A double ring
was immediately formed, the ladies being seated in a
circle with the gentlemen standing in their rear, the placing
of the chairs having naturally afforded opportunity
for some pretty pieces of gallantry.</p>

<p>Paul was secretly conscious that though Zabern with
Katina and Juliska might regard him favorably, he did
not possess the sympathy of the rest of the persons present,
who resented the unaccountable act of their princess
in appointing as her secretary one who was not only a foreigner
but a complete stranger to the principality. Were
there no loyal Czernovese from whom her choice might
have been made?</p>

<p>Paul knew, too, that among those who stood around
were some who bore the proudest names in Polish history;
he himself had neither title nor long genealogy, but if
there be an order of nobility founded upon superiority in
swordsmanship he determined to show that he was a member
of that order, and that it would not be well for any
man to put a slight upon him, because of the favor shown
him by the princess.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>On finding himself engaged in a contest with the
premier Paul felt some mortification at being pitted
against one so aged; but a few moments' play convinced
him that Radzivil's arm had lost little of its youthful
strength, or of its suppleness and dexterity. Paul, however,
was decidedly the superior; and, within the space
of five minutes he succeeded in disarming the count,
whose blade flying through the air would have struck
Katina, had she not adroitly warded it off with her own
fencing-foil.</p>

<p>Zabern, who had watched Paul with eyes that had
hardly winked once, seemed pleased with the result.</p>

<p>"An accident!" commented Dorislas, really believing
the premier to have been the superior of the two.</p>

<p>He himself was the next to engage, and again Zabern
watched every motion of Paul with unwinking eyes.</p>

<p>As a swordsman Dorislas excelled Radzivil; but,
heated with a desire to vindicate the honor of Czernova,
which he conceived had suffered at the hands of the
premier, he became rash, was more disposed to attack
than to guard, and the second contest terminated in less
time than the first by the button of Paul's sabre coming
full tilt against the breast of the Finance Minister.</p>

<p>"Fairly pinked!" said Zabern, evidently more pleased
than before. "No accident this time."</p>

<p>The expression of surprise and bewilderment on the
face of Dorislas at a result so little anticipated by himself
was so comically pathetic that the spectators could not
refrain from laughter.</p>

<p>"You were a dead man, Dorislas, had that been a real
duel," they cried.</p>

<p>Paul was beginning to rise in their esteem.</p>

<p>Miroslav next ventured to try his hand, and once
more Zabern became so attentive that one might almost
have fancied his own life hung upon the issue.</p>

<p>Profiting by the lesson of Dorislas' rashness the governor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of the Citadel commenced in a spirit of coolness and
watchfulness,&mdash;a spirit that quickly evaporated when he
found himself met at every point. He gave more trouble
than his predecessors, but in the end Paul succeeded in
twisting the weapon from his hand.</p>

<p>Zabern's pleasure increased.</p>

<p>"Good luck, not science," cried Miroslav, hotly, "I
defy you to repeat that trick, Captain Woodville. I must
have a second bout."</p>

<p>This demand was not allowed by Zabern, though Paul
himself good-naturedly offered to grant it.</p>

<p>"Miroslav seems in savage mood to-day," whispered
a fair lady to the cavalier who was bending over her.</p>

<p>"He suffered a prisoner to escape yesterday," replied
her partner, "and as a consequence he had a <i>mauvais
quart d'heure</i> with the princess this morning. <i>Hinc illæ
lacrimæ.</i>"</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville ought now to give his arm a rest,"
cried Katina.</p>

<p>But Paul, perceiving the favorable impression that he
was making, expressed his readiness to proceed without
delay.</p>

<p>"I am now to be your opponent," said Zabern, taking
up a fencing-blade in his left and only hand, "and I warn
you, Captain Woodville, to be careful."</p>

<p>This caution was not without its need. Zabern was
considered by those best qualified to judge the second
swordsman in Czernova, and Paul quickly found that he
had met an opponent nearly equal, if not equal, to himself.
The marshal had an arm of steel; as a warrior who
had faced the charge of bayonets on many a battle-field
he was not likely to become nervous in a mock-contest.
Cool and wary, after a few preliminary passes designed
to test the other's skill, Zabern seemed content to remain
for the most part on the defensive, watching his opportunity.
Paul, conscious of the marshal's dexterity, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
disposed to do the same; and hence this fourth bout appeared
somewhat tame when contrasted with the spirited
and dashing style of the preceding contests. It promised
to prove indefinitely long, till on a sudden Zabern
cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold, I have felt enough to know that I am your
inferior, and as such, Captain Woodville, I lower my
sword to you."</p>

<p>Which he did in graceful fashion, and, oddly enough,
seeming to be extremely pleased over this acknowledgment
of defeat.</p>

<p>"You would not have to make such confession, marshal,"
said Paul, "if you could recover the good hand
you left behind in Russia."</p>

<p>He turned to glance at his two remaining opponents,&mdash;Brunowski
and Nikita.</p>

<p>"If the marshal, the best of us all, admits himself
beaten," said the President of the Diet, "of what use is
it for me to try?"</p>

<p>The trooper murmured something to the like effect.</p>

<p>"Give me leave," said Paul, "to retire from this silver
line and to move about freely, and I will meet my two
remaining opponents together."</p>

<p>"That were to take an unfair advantage of a man,"
said Brunowski, resenting Paul's proposal as a slight
upon his swordsmanship.</p>

<p>"Fair or unfair," growled Zabern, "step forward, both
of you, and let us see whether Captain Woodville can do
it. If you deem his word a boast, prove it to be such."</p>

<p>The ladies, too, curiously eager to witness fresh proofs
of Paul's skill, added their voices to Zabern's, and thus
adjured the two men came forward and faced Paul.</p>

<p>As plenty of space would be required for the coming
bout, the ladies arose, the chairs were removed, and a
wide circuit formed.</p>

<p>"A thousand roubles to a hundred that the Englishman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
succeeds," said Zabern to Dorislas, who seeing confidence
written large on the marshal's face, declined the wager.</p>

<p>This fifth contest formed a brilliant finale.</p>

<p>Smarting under what they considered contemptuous
disparagement, and eager to punish the vanity of the
Englishman, Brunowski and Nikita pressed hard upon
Paul. Each was no mean fencer, though much inferior
to Zabern, and Paul was quickly compelled to retreat
from the silver line upon which he had at first planted
himself. The previous work seemed child's play when
compared with this. The interchange of cut and thrust
was so swift that the eyes of the spectators failed to follow
the dazzling motions of the weapons. Despite their
endeavors the two men failed to touch Paul, who at last
saw his opportunity. With one powerful stroke he
shivered Nikita's blade to fragments, and almost simultaneously
he planted the button of his sabre upon Brunowski's
breast.</p>

<p>The members of the assembly looked at one another
in breathless wonder. Among a people who, like the
Czernovese, retain much of the spirit of the feudal age, he
is most in esteem who is best able to defend himself. In
one sense, therefore, Paul was the foremost man in the
principality. The resentment previously felt against him
had now changed to unalloyed admiration.</p>

<p>"Such swordsmanship was never seen in Czernova,"
cried Juliska.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand devils!" muttered Zabern to himself.
"Why did her Highness intervene in the duel yesterday?"</p>

<p>And then aloud he added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ladies and lords, we must all admit that his grace of
Bora has much reason to be grateful to the princess."</p>

<p>No one ventured to controvert this statement.</p>

<p>Zabern's eyes twinkled with secret satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Marshal," whispered Juliska. "You have some plan
in your head. You have been trying an experiment, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
know you have. Come, tell me. Of what are you
thinking?"</p>

<p>"That the princess's coronation-day will be a very
exciting time," replied Zabern, oracularly.</p>

<p>And this was the only answer she could draw from the
smiling marshal.</p>

<p>"Beaten! The whole six!" cried Katina in a voice of
grief. "Shame upon Czernova! Captain Woodville will
have but a poor opinion of us. Let us show, however,
that we can shoot if we cannot fence."</p>

<p>With this Katina directed one of the attendants to hang
a square white-painted board upon the wall at one end of
the hall. Then taking her station at the other end with a
supply of loaded revolvers, she proceeded to aim at the
distant board, the shots succeeding each other with a
rapidity that scarcely left an interval of silence.</p>

<p>The result of this firing was to cause a large oval to
appear upon the surface of the board. The revolvers having
been reloaded, Katina resumed her shooting. Now
within the oval lines and curves began to appear, the
whole assuming the outline of a human countenance, and
that so well executed as to be clearly recognizable by
those acquainted with the original.</p>

<p>"Orloff, the governor-general of Warsaw," cried several
voices in unison.</p>

<p>"Czernova will never lack a good tirailleur so long as
Katina Ludovska be living," said Zabern, adding in a
lower tone, "why have you learned to shoot so well?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask?" she replied in a fierce whisper.
"Against the day of my meeting with Orloff. Can any
one beat that shooting?" she added aloud, with an invitatory
glance at Paul, who smiled a negative.</p>

<p>A shout of applause went up in favor of Katina, who
was considered to have redeemed the honor of Czernova.</p>

<p>"Ah! why were you not born a Pole?" said Juliska,
addressing Paul.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"May I not become one?"</p>

<p>"Then shall you be a better Pole than any of us," said
Katina, "for whereas we are such by accident of birth,
you will be such by freedom of choice."</p>

<p>"Well said, Katina," observed Zabern. "And never
was there one whom I more willingly admit to Czernovese
citizenship. But Captain Woodville," he added, thoughtfully,
"it will be well if you remain a British subject for
a few more days. Why, the sequel will show."</p>

<p>And Paul, believing that Zabern did not speak without
good reason, assented to the delay.</p>

<p>There was no more fencing in the <i>salle d'armes</i> that
day. The members shrank from displaying their inferior
powers before such an expert as Paul. The assembly
broke up into little groups.</p>

<p>"And how fares our ducal prisoner?" asked Radzivil,
addressing the governor of the Citadel.</p>

<p>"In somewhat gloomy mood," answered Miroslav.
"He spends his time chiefly in drinking old Rhenish,
and in muttering to himself. By the way, he did a very
peculiar act immediately after entering the Citadel last
evening."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Zabern, catching at this. "What
was the act?"</p>

<p>"You know, marshal, it is our rule to search all prisoners
on their entering,&mdash;a routine from which we did
not except even his grace."</p>

<p>"And what did you discover?"</p>

<p>"Upon his person&mdash;nothing; that is, nothing of consequence.
But a few minutes afterwards a soldier caught
sight of the remains of a book burning upon a fire that
was close by."</p>

<p>"Flung there by the duke?"</p>

<p>"Without doubt. The mystery is how he contrived to
do it without our knowledge, inasmuch as there were
several persons standing by."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"You recovered the book from the flames?"</p>

<p>"We attempted to remove it with the tongs, but the
thing fell to pieces; the pages were consumed; nothing
but the leather cover remained, and that all charred; upon
it we could just discern the title."</p>

<p>"And that was&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"'The Plays of Æschylus.' Now why should the duke
desire to destroy his copy of the Greek poet?"</p>

<p>"He had a motive, I warrant, and that a powerful one.
I wish, Miroslav, you had secured the volume in time.
Æschylus, Æschylus," repeated Zabern, thoughtfully.
"My classical scholarship has long since evaporated, but
if I remember rightly," he added, his countenance suddenly
lighting up with a new idea, "Æschylus wrote a play
called 'The Furies.'"</p>

<p>"True, marshal," replied Paul. "'The Eumenides' or
'The Furies.'"</p>

<p>Zabern, with excitement gleaming in his face, drew
Paul aside.</p>

<p>"The clew to the cipher despatch!" he whispered.
"The last words of our friend Trevisa were '<i>the
furies</i>'!"
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER X<br /><br />
THE DEED OF MICHAEL THE GUARDSMAN</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>Accompanied by Zabern, Paul returned to the
palace, where he was met by the court chamberlain,
who conducted him to a fine suite of apartments,
which by the special command of the princess
were assigned to the new secretary.</p>

<p>Supplied by Zabern with the cipher despatch, and by
the court librarian with a copy of the "Eumenides," Paul,
having first requested to be left to himself, sat down to
work out the cryptographic problem.</p>

<p>The paper given to him by the marshal was covered
with rows of numerals, separated from each other by
dots.</p>

<p>The first eight numbers were as follows,&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2 center">
6 . 42 . 50 . 37 . 97 . 39 . 65 . 21</p>

<p class="p2">What did these figures represent? Certain words in
the Greek play? If the sixth word of the "Eumenides,"
the forty-second, the fiftieth and so forth, were picked
out and placed in immediate sequence, would they yield
an intelligible sentence?</p>

<p>He tried this method with the above numbers, but the
result did not encourage him to proceed.</p>

<p>It was not likely that the writer of the despatch intended
to forward such intelligence as: "Of gods and
a name a daughter of an art was seated into an oracle."</p>

<p>On reflection Paul perceived the improbability that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
numbers stood for words, inasmuch as the vocabulary of
an ancient Greek poet would be insufficient to supply all
the terms required by the usages of modern civilization,
such, for example, as passport, banknote, or rifle. And
to clench the matter, Paul observed that towards the end
of the despatch there was the number, .8537. Now the
total of words in the "Eumenides" falls considerably
short of that sum.</p>

<p>But if all the letters that composed the words of the
play were numbered in consecutive order from &#928; the
first to &#962; the last, then, indeed, the sum total would far
exceed 8537.</p>

<p>Paul resolved to test this theory, namely, that 6 was
intended to mean the sixth letter in the "Eumenides,"
42 the forty-second letter, etc.</p>

<p>Great was his delight when he produced the following
result,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">
. 6 . 42 . 50. 37 . 97 . 39 . 65 . 21 .</p>

<p class="center">&#957;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#953;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#954;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#959;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#955;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#945;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#959;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#962;</p>

<p class="p2">Nicholas, the name of the reigning Czar!</p>

<p>Proceeding in the same fashion, Paul found that the
numbers following those which stood for Nicholas
yielded the intelligible word <i>&#959;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</i>, "assents."</p>

<p>"To what does Nicholas assent?" murmured Paul.</p>

<p>"Let me endeavor to ascertain, since it is quite clear that
the key to the cipher is now in my hands."</p>

<p>Obviously his best course would be to go through the
"Eumenides" first, marking, say, every tenth letter with
its proper consecutive number. This done, the work of
decipherment would take but a few minutes.</p>

<p>Paul started on this most monotonous task,&mdash;a task
that occupied him more than four hours, from the necessity
imposed upon him of verifying his enumeration from
time to time, for a single error in his calculation would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
have confused the whole issue. And when at last his
copy of the "Eumenides" lay ready figured for use, the
misgiving seized him that perhaps, after all, his labor
had been in vain.</p>

<p>"Various readings occur in the manuscripts of the
'Eumenides,'" he muttered. "If the writer of this despatch
has used a different edition from mine,&mdash;<i>Dindorf,
Lips.</i> 1827,&mdash;well, then, lack-a-day!"</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, the result falsified his misgiving.</p>

<p>Once during his calculations the eager Zabern had entered
the apartment with the question, "What progress?"</p>

<p>"Return in two hours, and you shall have the solution."</p>

<p>And the marshal had withdrawn, somewhat doubtful
of Paul's ability to make good his promise.</p>

<p>However, before the expiration of the two hours Paul
had mastered the contents of the document. It was written
in Greek, and, as the marshal's knowledge of that
language was extremely limited, Paul spent some time
in endeavoring to produce a faithful translation. And
his rendering was as follows,&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Nicholas assents. So proceed quickly. Risk of discovery
in transmitting document. Therefore burn as
soon as seized. When done, report matter. Envoy will
follow to demand production.</i></p>

<p><i>Lipski's measure approved. Money shall be forwarded
by usual route. Let him bribe freely. The success of his
bill Russia's justification. Impossible, then, for Europe
to oppose annexation.&mdash;ORLOFF.</i></p>

<p class="p2">The signature seemed to show that the letter came from
the governor-general of Warsaw, the knouter of Katina,
but there was nothing to indicate the person for whom it
was intended. Paul had little doubt as to the correctness
of his decipherment, though the meaning was far from
clear to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>Zabern would doubtless be able to understand the allusions,
and if the marshal should not soon make his appearance
Paul was resolved to go in quest of him.</p>

<p>The night was now far advanced, and, having been at
work several hours in a close chamber, Paul was beginning
to feel somewhat languid. He therefore walked forward
and opened a casement to gain a breath of the
fresher air without.</p>

<p>It was dark and cloudy, and as he stood looking forth
a mournful wind dashed rain-drops into his face.</p>

<p>The part of the palace in which this apartment was situated
formed the extremity of an architectural wing, which
was fronted at the distance of about a hundred feet by a
second wing equal in length to the first and parallel with
it. These two wings formed with the main structure the
three sides of a court.</p>

<p>As he casually turned his eyes upon the opposite wing,
at the point where it formed an angle with the main building,
Paul thought he detected a movement on the part of
somebody or something about half-way between the roof
and the ground. Straining his eyes to the utmost, he became
convinced that what he saw dimly outlined against
the gray wall was the figure of a man poised in mid-air;
for as Paul could detect no ladder beneath him, he could
only come to the conclusion that the fellow was suspended
by a rope.</p>

<p>The man made no attempt to ascend or descend, but
continued in the one position; and as far as Paul could
discern in the darkness his arm was moving to and fro
with horizontal motion.</p>

<p>Now just at the place where this man hung there was,
as Paul had observed earlier in the evening, a small window,
a window crossed by iron bars.</p>

<p>A grated window in a palace suggests the idea that the
room thus secured is used for the preservation of things
valuable; at any rate this was Paul's idea. He believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
that the fellow was quietly removing the iron bars with
the view of procuring whatever it was that lay behind
them.</p>

<p>It was an extremely hazardous enterprise. True, the
man was favored by the darkness, and by the noise of
wind and rain, but at any moment he was liable to be surprised
by the night-watch going its rounds, either in the
courtyard below or on the roof above.</p>

<p>Two sentinels paced the very battlements overlooking
this court. Earlier in the evening Paul had heard their
footsteps overhead and their challenges. Were they
asleep? If not, they must be keeping a very lax watch
to permit this man to perform such work under their
very eyes.</p>

<p>Then the truth flashed upon Paul. The man himself
was a soldier, one of the two appointed to patrol this particular
part of the roof. The other was his confederate.
Both were engaged in some nefarious work. Treason
was afoot in the palace!</p>

<p>Rejecting his first impulse, which was to steal quietly
downstairs and summon the guard, Paul resolved to
tackle the two single-handed. As there was no staircase
from his room to the roof, he determined to mount to the
battlements by means of a water-pipe adjacent to his
window.</p>

<p>Thrusting a loaded pistol within his breast, he stepped
out upon the window-sill, and pulling himself up by the
water-pipe silently and quickly, he clambered over the
battlements without detection. Keeping within an embrasure,
he peered out along the roof. There, a few
yards distant, outlined against the sky, was the tall,
cloaked figure of a sentinel leaning upon his rifle and
with his eyes turned towards the grated window.</p>

<p>Paul, glancing in the same direction, could no longer
see the man hanging in mid-air. A faint glow of light
stole through the mysterious window. Hence Paul concluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
that the fellow was now within the chamber occupied
upon the matter that had brought him there.</p>

<p>Stealing noiselessly forward, Paul suddenly clapped
his hand upon the sentinel's shoulder, and, pointing to
the grated window he cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you intend to arrest that villain, or are you his
confederate?"</p>

<p>The sentinel instantly turned, with confusion and guilt
written upon his face. Misled by the uniform, he took
Paul for a Czernovese officer, and as such he was one
that must be silenced at all costs, for it was death to be
caught thus in the act of treason.</p>

<p>Lowering his bayonetted rifle to the charge, he made a
thrust at Paul's body. But Paul, on the watch for this
movement, sprang aside, wrested the rifle away, and
clubbing it, dealt the fellow a fearful blow on the head.
The sentinel staggered back and dropped to the pavement,
where he lay senseless and still.</p>

<p>Peering over the battlements to learn whether this
action on his part had been observed, Paul was surprised
to see a blue light at the chamber-window. The man
was flashing a lantern to and fro, an action that lasted
for a few seconds.</p>

<p>Recovering from his surprise, Paul sped onward, and
reached the battlement to which the rope was attached.</p>

<p>Kneeling within an embrasure and glancing downwards,
he perceived a faint cloud of smoke proceeding
from the window.</p>

<p>What was taking place within? Was the fellow setting
fire to this part of the palace?</p>

<p>It was not in Paul's nature to remain inactive while
evil was in progress. He instantly resolved to descend to
the chamber for the purpose of putting a stop to what he
could not doubt was nefarious work. Grasping the rope
with both hands, he swung himself downwards, not
neglecting, however, at the same time to keep an eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
upon the window. As soon as his feet touched the sill
he drew forth his pistol, and without pausing to notice
what was happening within the room, without a glance,
even, he sent his feet through the space between the bars,
a space barely sufficient to admit the passage of his body.</p>

<p>The room was in darkness,&mdash;this much he was conscious
of as he shot forward, and a smell as of smoke
hung in the air. Paul fell supine upon the stone flooring,
but he was up again in an instant, endeavoring to
ascertain through the gloom what strange thing had happened
or was happening.</p>

<p>His attention was immediately arrested by a strange
voice,&mdash;a voice lowered to a whisper that was full of
guilty terror.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Peter? What has brought you down?
In God's name make no noise. Gabor is on guard in the
corridor outside."</p>

<p>"Then let Gabor enter," shouted Paul in a voice of
thunder. "Ho! without there! Gabor, Gabor, whoever
you may be, here is a prisoner for you."</p>

<p>Directed by the voice, Paul rushed forward through
the darkness, and with his left hand he clutched the fellow
by the throat, intending to reduce him to submission
by pressing the barrel of the pistol to his forehead. The
uplifting of the fellow's arm sent the weapon flying from
Paul's hand, and next moment the two men were grappling
savagely together.</p>

<p>The soldier, for Paul could tell that he was such by
the feel of his uniform, was a powerful fellow, and desperation
had now doubled his strength. He knew that
the chamber-door was strong, and that the key was not
in the hands of the sentinels outside; if he could overcome
this present antagonist in the interval that must
elapse before the key could be procured, there was a possibility
of his escaping. He wrestled, therefore, with all
the fury of a wild beast.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>Locked in each other's arms, the two men swayed
backwards and forwards, and then fell, rolling over and
over.</p>

<p>Paul's cry, together with the noise of the scuffle, had
attracted the notice of the guard posted at the end of the
corridor leading to this chamber. The shouting of voices
and the running of feet were heard on the other side of
the door.</p>

<p>"Ho! Lasco, off to the captain for the key. The devil's
work is going on within. How have they managed to
get inside? Ah, by the window! Melchior, up to the
battlement, and cover the window with your rifle. See
they escape not! Now, Lasco, dolt! dullard! slowbody!
don't stand gaping there. Run for the key. The key,
man, the key!"</p>

<p>"The key <i>is</i> here!" cried a deep, powerful voice. And
above the oaths and gasps of his struggling opponent,
Paul could hear Zabern's Hessian boots clattering along
the corridor.</p>

<p>"Lasco, quick! Yon lamp! hold it up!" cried the
marshal. "Gabor and Melchior, as I open the door,
rush in and cover them with your rifles. Now!"</p>

<p>The key rattled in the lock; the massive door swung
back upon its hinges, and the two sentinels, eager to learn
what was taking place, rushed in with rifles levelled, ready
to fire at any one who should offer resistance.</p>

<p>They paused in blank amazement at beholding by the
light of the lamp one of their own corps stretched supine
and panting, with Paul Woodville above pinning him to
the floor by the throat.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Michael!" cried Gabor.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of his excitement Paul observed that
Zabern was carrying in his hand a sheet of paper which
he recognized as his translation of the cipher despatch.</p>

<p>"In time, thank heaven!" murmured the marshal,
from which remark Paul concluded that the mission of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the traitor-sentinel was connected in some way with Orloff's
letter.</p>

<p>"Gabor, Lasco, Melchior, leave us. Close the door;
retire to the far end of the corridor, and on your lives
stir not from that spot till I call."</p>

<p>The three sentinels retired.</p>

<p>"Good-night to Michael!" whispered Gabor to his two
comrades. "We shall never see him again. I know that
look in the marshal's eye."</p>

<p>Paul, little the worse for the struggle, released his hold
of the soldier and rose to his feet. But it was beyond the
power of the other to rise. Fear, inspired by the presence
of the dark-frowning Zabern, kept him motionless
and mute. He sat the picture of abject terror.</p>

<p>Now that Paul was free to look around, he observed
that he was within a vaulted stone chamber, about twenty
feet square, and but scantily supplied with furniture. In
one part there was a small iron chest fixed to the wall
with staples. Paul, by some intuition, divined that
Michael's nefarious attempt was directed against the
contents of this chest.</p>

<p>Zabern made one swift stride towards the coffer, and
seemed relieved at finding it locked.</p>

<p>Turning again, he folded his arms and faced the man
with a terrible frown.</p>

<p>"I shall not ask your object in coming here. You and
I both know that. So you haven't got it?"</p>

<p>Michael made no reply.</p>

<p>"It is still safe?"</p>

<p>Michael remained mute. He seemed literally frozen
with terror.</p>

<p>"Why so silent, fellow? Your tongue wagged ever
loudest in the guard-house."</p>

<p>"When I first entered," observed Paul, "smoke hung
about the place."</p>

<p>An enthusiastic orator in the Diet had once described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Zabern as "the man who had never known fear." The
statement, if true at the time of the utterance, was certainly
not true now. Fear in all its power fell upon the
heart of the marshal as his eye caught sight of a passage
in the paper which he held: "Risk of discovery in
transmitting document. Therefore burn as soon as
seized."</p>

<p>"Hell shall seize you, fellow, if you have done so!"
he cried. "Did you come provided with a key, then?
Where is it?"</p>

<p>Still Michael made no reply. Zabern, following the
direction of his eyes, perceived a key lying upon the
floor. The marshal placed it within the lock of the chest,
turned it, raised the lid, and saw that the coffer contained
nothing but a heap of charred parchment. Zabern,
his mouth drawn in an agony that showed all his
white teeth, rose, and with a dreadful look in his eyes
turned slowly round upon the guilty man.</p>

<p>A cry for mercy rang through the chamber as the marshal
sprang forward with drawn sabre. His was not a
'prentice hand; he knew exactly where to find the fifth
rib. A swift stab,&mdash;the fall of a body, and then all was
silent, save for the mournful plash of the rain outside.</p>

<p>Paul was shocked by the ferocity of Zabern's action,
which had been performed with a quickness that left no
time for intervention.</p>

<p>"Without a court-martial!" he said, severely. "We
act not so in England."</p>

<p>"I dare not let him live to see those fellows outside
again, lest they should learn from him what he has done.
Not a hint as to his deed must ever get abroad; for he
who knows it holds the destiny of Czernova in the hollow
of his hand. Not even to a secret tribunal must the truth
be whispered. And, Captain Woodville," continued Zabern,
raising his dripping sabre with so menacing an air
that Paul immediately stepped backward, and set hand to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
his own sword-hilt, "if I thought that you could not hold
your peace I would slay you, too."</p>

<p>"What has he done?" asked Paul, impressed by the
marshal's strange manner.</p>

<p>"The blackest deed that could be done against the
princess, and one that has destroyed the liberties of a
whole people. Your decipherment of the secret despatch
has come too late to do us good,&mdash;too late. Oh! the bitterness
of it, by a few moments only."</p>

<p>"I am still in the dark, marshal."</p>

<p>"On what is the liberty of Czernova based? On the
Charter granted to us by Catherine of Russia. And that
Charter is now burnt paper. This is the first act in the
drama. The next will be, as this despatch shows, the
appearance of an envoy from the Czar to demand on
what grounds Czernova, formerly a part of Russian Poland,
claims to be independent. What answer can we
give? What title can we show? Without our Charter
we are completely at the mercy of the Czar. His ministers
will loudly affirm that such Charter was never
granted, that we have obtained autonomy by a lying
statement, that all extant copies of the Charter are based
upon a mythical document, that its mention in history is
no proof of its past existence. 'Let us see the original,'
will be their cry. 'Produce the autograph signature of
the Empress Catherine.' Now do you understand the
crime that this miscreant has wrought?"</p>

<p>The diabolical nature of the plot struck Paul with a
feeling akin to horror. His thoughts immediately flew to
Barbara, sleeping peacefully at that moment in her distant
quarter of the palace, all unconscious of this new
peril that threatened her throne. He felt little pity now
for the slain wretch lying at his feet.</p>

<p>"Why did he not carry off the document to Russia?"</p>

<p>"The secret despatch assigns the reason. It was more
expedient to destroy it as soon as it fell into his hands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
The sequel proves the serpentine wisdom of Orloff. Had
this fellow concealed the Charter upon his own person it
would now be in our keeping again. Oh! I could tear
out my eyes for having kept such sorry watch! 'Warden
of the Charter' is one of my titles. A pretty warden,
truly! Fortunately you and I alone know that Russia's
plot has succeeded, for those sentries at the end of the
corridor are ignorant of it; in fact they do not even know
that the Charter was kept here, in this, the Eagle Tower."</p>

<p>"I fear, marshal, that there are others who know,"
said Paul, picking up a lantern with a blue glass slide.
"This was flashed to and fro at the window,&mdash;what else
but as a signal to some distant watcher that the Charter
is no more?"</p>

<p>The marshal ground his teeth as he recognized the
force of Paul's inference.</p>

<p>"Then we may expect the Czar's envoy at an early
date," he replied. "This villain," he continued, examining
the window, "gained ingress by removing the concrete
in which the bars were embedded,&mdash;a task which
must have occupied two or three nights. What were the
patrol on the roof doing to allow of this?"</p>

<p>"He himself was one of the patrol," said Paul, quickly
adding, "Ah! that reminds me. There is a second fellow
on the battlements whom I knocked senseless with his
own rifle."</p>

<p>"Another? By heaven, Captain Woodville, you have
done wrong in forgetting him. If he should have escaped
with the tidings of what has been done!"</p>

<p>Zabern darted from the chamber, and, rushing past the
three sentinels standing at the end of the corridor, he ran
up a winding staircase that led to the roof. He was
closely followed by Paul. The traitor-sentry was still
lying in the place where Paul had left him. Zabern's
examination did not last a moment.</p>

<p>"He will never play the traitor again," remarked the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
marshal. "You have shattered his skull for him. And
without a court-martial, too!" he added, dryly.</p>

<p>Having called up Gabor and his two companions, Zabern
directed them to inter the two bodies, at the same
time enjoining the trio to observe strict secrecy upon the
events of that night; after which orders he proceeded to
pace moodily to and fro upon the battlements in company
with Paul, who, puzzled by one circumstance in the affair,
sought enlightenment of the marshal.</p>

<p>"Since Orloff's letter authorizing the plot was not delivered
to its intended recipient but fell into your hands,
how comes it that the plot has nevertheless been carried
out?"</p>

<p>"Two messengers may have been sent, each carrying
a similar communication; or it may be that when Russakoff
did not return within an assigned time, Orloff, growing
alarmed, despatched a second letter, which, alas! has
produced the desired result."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that the Czar is really accessory to
this plot?"</p>

<p>"Accessory? Why not its author?" queried Zabern,
ever ready to see in the Czar the incarnation of wickedness.
"There is a Byzantine finesse about this plot which
accords very well with the character of Nicholas, who
has been styled a 'Greek of the Lower Empire.' But
whether accessory or not, be sure that he will avail himself
of the weapon with which the action of his subordinates
has supplied him. You know who works the plot
on this side of the Czernovese border."</p>

<p>"The Duke of Bora?"</p>

<p>"Who but he? And yet I still lack decisive proof of
his treason. I fear I acted somewhat too hastily in slaying
Michael the guardsman. I should have endeavored
first to extract the names of his principals. I am without
hold upon the duke."</p>

<p>Paul here ventured to remind the marshal of Bora's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
suspicious conduct in burning his copy of the poet
Æschylus.</p>

<p>"True," replied Zabern, "that the cipher despatch depends
for its solution upon 'The Eumenides,' and equally
true that the duke burns a book containing this same
play. But what of that? 'Mere coincidence,' his defenders
would reply. Besides, I dare not bring the duke
to trial, either secretly or openly, upon this charge."</p>

<p>"'I dare not' from the marshal!"</p>

<p>"Why, consider. I should have to proclaim to his
judges the startling fact that Czernova is now without
her Charter, a secret that must be kept concealed from
all men; nay, even from the princess herself. Captain
Woodville, let not her Highness know of this loss. She
has political embarrassments enough already. Why
should we spring a new trouble upon her?"</p>

<p>"Count me tongue-tied, marshal, where the princess's
peace of mind is concerned."</p>

<p>Zabern continued to pace backwards and forwards,
glancing from time to time at the translation of the cipher
letter which he still held in his hand, and muttering language,
the drift of which was not altogether clear to
Paul.</p>

<p>"What is this? Lipski's measure approved because
its success would justify Russia in annexing Czernova.
Ha! so that's the motive that prompts Lipski's action.
His bill is aimed not so much at the Catholic Church of
Czernova as at the Convent of the Transfiguration. Some
inkling of the interior workings of that monastery has
reached him, and he would fain turn the light of publicity
upon them. No wonder that Orloff desires this
bill to pass, and that he is sending Lipski rouble-notes
with which to corrupt the Polish members of the Diet.
'Money shall be forwarded by usual route.' Ha! I'll
set a watch on Lipski, and on those who visit him.
'T were no great shame if some of those rouble-notes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
should find their way to our own Exchequer. Humph!
Czernova at present is in a truly critical state. But, no
matter," he added, with his face grimly set, "let perils
come! They shall find me equal to them. What said
Peter the Great: 'It takes three Jews to outwit a Russian'?
It will take a good many Russians to outwit a
Zabern."
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XI<br /><br />
THE ENVOY OF THE CZAR</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning Paul by command attended in the
White Saloon, where, under the sweet tuition of
the princess herself, he was initiated into the
duties of his new office. Doubtless his affection for Barbara
caused him to infuse into his work an earnestness
and an energy which he might not otherwise have felt;
however, be that as it may, when in the course of a few
days Barbara avowed that he was an ideal secretary, she
was uttering no empty compliment.</p>

<p>Those who had ascribed Paul's appointment to love on
the part of the princess were somewhat perplexed on
observing the demeanor of each towards the other, for,
however tender and familiar their intercourse in private,
they did not permit their affection to betray itself in public
by look, word, or sign, Paul always evincing the modest
deference of an inferior, while Barbara maintained
towards her new secretary the authoritative dignity of a
princess. The quick-witted Zabern was not to be deceived
by this acting, but whatever he may have thought
of the wisdom of the princess's choice, the prudent marshal
kept his own counsel; for, strange as the statement
might have sounded to the rest of the Czernovese ministry,
Paul's sword, and his alone, would be absolutely
indispensable to the security of the princess's crown in
a certain contingency of the future, as the marshal, who
was a far-seeing man, very well knew.</p>

<p>As regards Cardinal Ravenna that ecclesiastic had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
smiled sourly to himself on hearing of Paul's appointment
to the secretaryship, but he did not deem the time yet ripe
to electrify Czernovese with the announcement that their
princess was not Natalie Lilieska. Indeed on the third
day after the interrupted duel Ravenna had received a
summons from Rome to attend an important conclave
there. The cardinal much preferred Slavowitz to the
Vatican. Barbara's attitude of defiance towards himself,
together with the friendship that had so suddenly sprung
up betwixt Zabern and Paul, gave him much uneasiness;
but as it was not to his interest to disobey the command of
Pio Nono the cardinal had departed for Rome, and for a
time Barbara was relieved from his menacing presence.
But for a time only. He would return, and his return
would be the beginning of trouble.</p>

<p>So passed many days during which the Duke of Bora
remained a prisoner in the Citadel, though Barbara's
action in detaining him there without trial had been
the subject of a very pertinent question in the Diet by
Lipski, the Muscovite deputy for Russograd, a question
to which Zabern had curtly answered that it was a matter
which did not concern the honorable deputy; whereupon
the said honorable deputy made reply (and it took him
two hours to say it) that inasmuch as the duke was a
member of the Diet, it did concern both himself and
every other member; and that freedom had come to a
pretty pass in Czernova when deputies who gave offence
could be arrested by the arbitrary will of an irresponsible
maiden, and could even find ministers to defend her action.
When Lipski had sat down amid the cheers of his
Muscovite supporters, Zabern deprived the tirade of most
of its points by showing that the duke had made a voluntary
surrender of himself with full knowledge that he
would be detained during the princess's pleasure, and that
if the duke on reflection had repented of the step he had
taken, it was quite open to him to appeal to the law of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Czernova, which was more powerful even than the will of
the princess.</p>

<p>But Bora declined this course, knowing that if he
should be tried in a legal way his sentence would be an
imprisonment of six months; therefore, though chafing
daily and secretly vowing vengeance upon Paul, he
deemed it more politic to await the pleasure of the
princess.</p>

<p>This debate in the Diet did not cause Barbara to release
the duke one day earlier than the time previously fixed by
her, for the fair ruler of Czernova could be extremely self-willed
when she chose, as those who had opposed her had
often found to their cost.</p>

<p>One morning as Paul entered the White Saloon to
commence his usual duties, Barbara, with a glance at his
face, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The mark has disappeared from your cheek, Paul,
and therefore it is time for the release of Bora, according
to my word; unless," she added, deferentially, "unless
you are opposed to it."</p>

<p>Though lacking proof, Paul did not doubt that the duke
was a traitor; and, moreover, he strongly suspected him
of having instigated the assassination of Trevisa; otherwise
it mattered little to Paul whether Bora was free man
or prisoner.</p>

<p>He offered, however, no opposition to the duke's release,
feeling not a little flattered that the princess should
have submitted such a question to himself.</p>

<p>An order was accordingly despatched to the governor
of the Citadel for the liberation of the duke; and now
Barbara braced her mind to meet the fresh trouble that
she felt to be in store for her. "For," she murmured to
herself with a sigh, "when Bora shall hear from my own
lips that he must abandon the idea of marrying me, he is
certain to become my enemy." Here, however, Barbara
erred in supposing that antagonism from the duke would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
be a new thing, inasmuch as Bora could hardly become a
greater enemy in the future than he had been in the past.
That same evening Paul in the quietude of his own compartment
received a visit from Zabern, who looked somewhat
more grave than usual.</p>

<p>"You were quite right in your opinion," he remarked,
"that the blue light flashed at the window by Michael the
guardsman was a signal to some distant watcher. The
loss of our Charter has become known to others. The plot
is developing. Whom, think you, we shall have in Slavowitz
on the third day from this? Feodor Orloff!"</p>

<p>"Feodor Orloff!"</p>

<p>"None but he. He comes in the sacred character of
envoy of the Czar, desiring an audience of the Princess of
Czernova. You can guess the object of his coming?"</p>

<p>"To demand a view of the Czernovese Charter!"</p>

<p>"What but that?"</p>

<p>"Marshal, we do wrong in continuing to conceal the
truth from the princess. She is of firm and courageous
mind, and can bear to hear of the loss. If, after the envoy
shall have formulated his demand, she should send for
the Charter&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"But she will not send for it. I have counselled her to
resist that, and every other demand made by the envoy.
The princess will assume an attitude of graceful refusal.
Trust me, she will know how to evade his demands.
When it is a matter of diplomatic finesse and word-fencing,
she can leave her ministers far behind."</p>

<p>Three days later at noon the Princess Natalie Lilieska&mdash;to
employ her state-name&mdash;prepared to give audience
to Count Feodor Orloff, the governor-general of Warsaw,
and envoy extraordinary of his Imperial Majesty the
Czar, Nicholas the First.</p>

<p>A few minutes previous to this interview a singular
scene took place in a private apartment of the palace reserved
for the use of Zabern. Just as the marshal was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
preparing to quit this sanctum to attend the reception of
the envoy, the door opened, and Katina Ludovska appeared
escorted by a file of troopers. The latter having
saluted, withdrew, leaving Katina alone with the marshal.</p>

<p>"So my spies have found you at last," he said, with an
air of grim satisfaction. "Where have you been hiding
for the last two days?"</p>

<p>"It is true, then, that I have been arrested by your orders?"
she cried with an angry flash of her eyes.</p>

<p>"Quite true. This apartment must be your abode for
the next few days. See how pretty I have made it for
you by introducing into it some of the princess's own furniture
and hangings! True, the windows are barred, but
you will not mind such trifles."</p>

<p>"Why am I here?"</p>

<p>"For the saving of your life. Do you know, Katina,
that if you should shoot Orloff, I, as Minister of Justice,
would have to see that you were hanged?"</p>

<p>"So you have divined my purpose?" she said, with a
bitter smile.</p>

<p>"And must frustrate it. Come, Katina, be sensible.
Would you violate the common law of nations?
In assassinating the Czar's ambassador you would be playing
the very devil with the public safety. Nicholas would
have good pretext, then, for annexing Czernova."</p>

<p>"And you would rob me of my vengeance?" she said
with a gesture of despair. "What other opportunity
shall I ever have? Long ago would I have entered
Russia to slay him, but that my face is known to all the
police agents there. The moment I set foot over the frontier
I should be seized and sent again to Orenburg."</p>

<p>"I sympathize with you, and probably if I were Katina
I should be tempted to do even as she would. But I am
Zabern, you see, and the princess's government is my first
care. Were Orloff in neutral territory you might shoot
him without hindrance from me&mdash;and glad would I be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
to hear of his death&mdash;but on Czernovese ground&mdash;no!
We should have to respect the devil himself if he should
come in the character of ambassador."</p>

<p>The distant fanfare of trumpets now rose and fell on
the air, signal that the envoy had arrived at the entrance
of the palace.</p>

<p>The sound seemed to madden Katina.</p>

<p>"Is he come here in pomp, to be graciously received by
the princess, to be feasted by her ministers, while I, his
victim, scarred with the knout for refusing to become his
plaything, am to remain still and do nothing to avenge
myself? Your state policy to the winds," she cried passionately.
"Stand aside. You shall not stay my hand."</p>

<p>She made as if she would have escaped from the apartment,
but Zabern, on the watch for this movement, intercepted
her and placed his back against the door.</p>

<p>"Nay, Katina, here you must remain till Orloff shall
have quitted Czernova."</p>

<p>She recognized the futility of resistance, and turning
away with her face very white, and speaking very slowly,
she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then if you prevent me from killing Orloff I will kill
myself." Her words startled Zabern from his cynical
composure. For a moment he hesitated whether to leave
her, for Katina looked as if she fully intended to carry
out her threat.</p>

<p>"Be it so," he said, coldly. "The guilt will not be
mine. Better that maid perish by her own hand than that
the liberties of a whole people be destroyed."</p>

<p>With that saying the marshal withdrew and having
locked the door upon Katina, he darkly wended his way
to the audience chamber.</p>

<p>With a view of rendering due honor to the imperial
envoy it had been decided by Barbara that the reception
should be attended with considerable pomp.</p>

<p>The Throne Hall was accordingly chosen as the place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
of interview&mdash;a magnificent apartment, its vaulted roof
fretted with gold. The frescoes and pictures were adapted
to appeal to the patriotism of those present, portraying,
as they did, some of the noblest events in Polish history;
among them the envoy might have seen more than one
Russian defeat by Polish arms.</p>

<p>Ranged round the saloon, with back to the wall, were
the finest and loftiest of the princess's uhlans. Clad in
gleaming breastplates, and with burnished lances erect,
they seemed in their rigidity and silence more like statues
than men.</p>

<p>Barbara occupied the throne, a slender gold diadem
resting on her dark hair, a purple robe of state looped
gracefully over her dainty white attire.</p>

<p>On each side of the throne were her ministers, and the
chief of her nobility. Patriots to a man, animated by a
spirit of defiance to Russia, ardent for the restoration of
Poland, they formed a chivalric band ready to die in
defence of their fair princess.</p>

<p>The scene was striking and poetical; and more than
once Paul, who was present, received a secret glance from
Barbara, as if she would fain invite him to contrast her
present state with that of the forlorn maiden wandering
in the Dalmatian forest; and truly, it was a marvellous
and brilliant contrast.</p>

<p>The emissary of the Czar was a man of giant stature
clad in a gorgeous uniform. His countenance gave indications
of a harsh and arrogant nature, nor did his countenance
belie him; as a matter of fact he had been
purposely selected by the Russian ministry in order that
his objectionable manners, combined with the catechetical
character of his mission might provoke recriminatory
language from the young and proud princess, language
that might afford Russia pretext for a quarrel with Czernova.
Therefore Barbara, warned of this beforehand by
Zabern, had determined that the envoy's speech, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
provocative, should not tempt her to play the enemy's
game.</p>

<p>To Paul and Zabern he was an object of secret loathing,
both as the knouter of Katina, and also as an accessory to,
if not the actual author of, the plot which had resulted in
the destruction of the Czernovese Charter. Hard necessity
precluded them from denouncing the hypocrisy of the
man who came to demand the production of what he had
himself destroyed.</p>

<p>"His grandfather did a noble deed," remarked Zabern
in a whisper to Paul.</p>

<p>"What did his grandfather do?"</p>

<p>"He strangled a Czar," replied Zabern, grimly.
"What?" he continued, noting Paul's look of surprise,
"did you not know that we have here the grandson of
Gregory Orloff?"</p>

<p>Unjust as it may be to be influenced by the ill-deeds of
a man's grandsire, Paul nevertheless found his aversion
to Orloff increasing, that such a creature should be appointed
ambassador to stand in the presence of the pure
and sweet Barbara! Orloff had removed his leathern
gauntlets, and Paul could not avoid glancing from time
to time at his large and knotted hands as if they were
the same mighty palms that had squeezed out the breath
from the windpipe of the unhappy Peter the Third.</p>

<p>With an odd mixture of humility and pride, the envoy
knelt before the throne, and having presented his credentials
to the princess, he rose again to his full height,
and began to speak in a loud voice, and with a sweeping
glance that took in the whole assembly.</p>

<p>"Nicholas Paulovitch, Autocrat of all the Russias"&mdash;Here
the envoy proceeded to enumerate a variety of titles,
among which there figured "King of Poland,"&mdash;a title
which made the more ardent patriots whisper, "For how
long?"&mdash;"Nicholas Paulovitch, as Head of the Holy
Greek Church throughout the world, is interested in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
learning whether the Princess of Czernova has seceded
from that Church."</p>

<p>Among Barbara's audience there was only one person
who knew that secession was not a term to apply to her
conduct. It was hard to be accused of apostasy, but political
necessity compelled her to submit to the imputation.</p>

<p>"Though denying the right of the Czar to catechize
the ruler of Czernova on such a matter I will, nevertheless,
give answer," responded Barbara quietly. "I am
not a member of the Greek, but of the Catholic Church."</p>

<p>"His Imperial Majesty would direct your Highness's
attention to the Czernovese coronation-oath, the formula
prescribed by the Charter."</p>

<p>"How is that oath phrased?" asked Barbara.</p>

<p>"Its precise wording is: 'I swear to maintain the
Greek Faith.'"</p>

<p>"And it is my intention to maintain it. The Greek
Church shall meet with no interference or oppression
from the Catholic princess. Its liberty and privileges shall
remain inviolate."</p>

<p>Orloff seemed quite dumfounded at this way of explaining
the oath. Recovering from his surprise, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is not the interpretation put upon those words
by the Czar. In his view 'maintaining' is synonymous
with 'believing.'"</p>

<p>"Not so, count," replied Barbara, firmly. "On this
point we have consulted not the forensic authorities of
Czernova, who might be suspected of favoring our interest,
but the leading jurists and statesmen of Europe, and
they are unanimous in the opinion that the coronation-oath
does not bind the ruler of Czernova to a personal
belief in the faith of the Greek Church, but merely imposes
the obligation of maintaining it as an establishment
<i>in statu quo</i>."</p>

<p>That the Czernovese ministry had been seeking the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
views of Europe in the matter of the coronation-oath came
upon Orloff as a complete surprise. If the princess had
spoken truly, the consensus of opinion would seem to
show that the argument by which Russia had been hoping
to exclude her from the throne was lacking in validity.
An appeal by Czernova to the arbitrament of the Powers
on this question would enable the principality to sail triumphantly
in the teeth of Russian ambition.</p>

<p>"I will report your answer to the Czar," replied Orloff,
and with mortification plainly visible on his face, he
proceeded to his next point.</p>

<p>"The Czar regrets the necessity which compels him to
prefer against the state of Czernova a charge of the
violation of his own jurisdiction in the matter of his
kinsman, the Duke of Bora, who while on Russian ground
was summarily arrested by order of the princess."</p>

<p>"Have you proof of this alleged violation of territory?"</p>

<p>"How?" exclaimed Orloff in feigned amazement.
"'Proof'? 'Alleged violation'? The sacred word of
his Majesty doubted?"</p>

<p>"I can of my own knowledge testify that his grace was
on Czernovese ground at the time of his arrest."</p>

<p>"We have our witnesses, Baron Ostrova, the duke's
secretary, and a Cossack sentinel."</p>

<p>A murmur of indignation ran through the assembly at
the envoy's insolent language.</p>

<p>"And you have the word of a princess," replied Barbara,
with dignity, "word purer far than that of twenty
Ostrovas or twenty Cossacks. But we have a witness
whom even the envoy of the Czar must respect. My
lord of Bora, stand forth."</p>

<p>And to the surprise of those, unaware till then of his
presence, the Duke of Bora, who had been keeping in the
background, came forward and stood before the throne.</p>

<p>However great his sympathy with the envoy's aims,
however much embittered with the princess by reason of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
his imprisonment, he durst not in her presence, and in the
presence of other witnesses of his arrest, state anything
else but the truth.</p>

<p>With a forced smile he bowed to Orloff, his fellow-conspirator.</p>

<p>"As the princess avers," he said, "there has been some
error on the part of his Majesty's informants. My arrest
took place on the Czernovese side of the frontier."</p>

<p>The envoy grew more disconcerted at this, his second
failure to entangle the princess in his political net.</p>

<p>"A twofold offence has been committed in his Majesty's
dominions," he continued; "first, in the matter of the
duel itself, duelling being contrary to the law of Russia;
and, secondly, in the matter of corrupting by bribes a
soldier of the Czar, a Cossack sentinel."</p>

<p>"That honest Cossack," said Barbara, sweetly, "whose
testimony you would have used against me?"</p>

<p>A smile rippled round the assembly.</p>

<p>Orloff flushed angrily.</p>

<p>"And therefore," he continued, ignoring Barbara's
pointed remark, "on the ground that they have broken
the law of Russia the Czar requires the extradition of the
two offenders, his grace the Duke of Bora, and the Englishman,
Captain Paul Woodville."</p>

<p>"The latter at all costs, I presume," said Barbara,
caustically.</p>

<p>A second smile went round the assembly; their eyes
with one accord turned towards the soldier who had
foiled the Russian arms at Tajapore.</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville," continued Barbara, and none
but Paul knew what pleasure it gave her thus to act as his
champion, "Captain Woodville, though resident in Czernova,
has not yet resigned the rights of a British subject,
and therefore it will be more prudent on our part to wait
till the English ambassador at St. Petersburg shall have
notified to us his will in this matter. Till such time the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
question of the duke's extradition must likewise remain
in abeyance."</p>

<p>Barbara's finesse in throwing her difficulty upon the
broad shoulders of the British representative drew a sour
smile from Orloff, who knew full well that that potentate
would never sanction the extradition of an English officer
on the grounds alleged.</p>

<p>Orloff was not slow to perceive the triumph of the
assembly. It was clear to him that so far in the course of
his embassy matters between Russia and Czernova would
have to remain <i>in statu quo</i>, inasmuch as the princess's
policy afforded no ground for quarrel. But Orloff had
other arrows in his quiver, and he prepared to discharge
them.</p>

<p>"The Czar would fain learn the meaning of the device
on the new Czernovese coinage."</p>

<p>"What signification does his Majesty himself attach
to it?"</p>

<p>"In his view the assumption of the arms of Poland
implies a claim to the throne of Poland,&mdash;a claim at variance
with his own lawful sovereignty over that realm."</p>

<p>"Count, tell us whose arms are those?"</p>

<p>And Barbara here directed Orloff's attention to a part
of the roof where hung a faded white banner, its centre
embroidered with the figure of a double-headed eagle in
black thread, a banner captured in old time from Russia,
and therefore no agreeable sight to the eyes of a Muscovite
general.</p>

<p>"They are the arms of Russia," replied Orloff sullenly,
and wondering why he should be asked the question.</p>

<p>"Yet that double-headed black eagle was the arms of
the Greek emperors of Constantinople," said Barbara.
"If my armorial device implies an aspiration for the
throne of Poland, then must the Czar be credited with an
aspiration for the throne of the Sultan. Are the chancelleries
of Europe to understand that such is his aim?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>Again the assembly smiled. Nicholas's intention of
seizing upon "the sick man's inheritance" was strongly
suspected at this time, but it would not have been politic
on the part of Orloff to affirm it. A scowl stole over his
face at this, his fourth defeat.</p>

<p>"As regards the arms of Poland," said Barbara, "I,
as a descendant of Polish kings, have every right to use
such arms upon my coinage."</p>

<p>"But has Czernova the right to issue a coinage of its
own apart from the Russian currency? Is it permitted by
the Charter of Catherine?"</p>

<p>"Marshal, cause a copy of the Charter to be
brought."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, your Highness," said Orloff quickly, and interchanging
a significant smile with the Duke of Bora,
a smile noticed and understood by Zabern, "not a copy.
We would see the original document itself."</p>

<p>Barbara stared hard at the speaker, having no suspicion
of his sinister purpose in preferring this request.</p>

<p>"You would see the original document?" she repeated.
"This is truly a singular demand. As the Charter was
signed in duplicate, why not consult your own original,
which, if history err not, was deposited in the archives of
the Kremlin?"</p>

<p>"We would, if it were there; but seek as we may, we
have never been able to find the alleged document!"</p>

<p>"Alleged document?" repeated Barbara, knitting her
brows. "Did you say alleged?"</p>

<p>"Yes," retorted Orloff, with an insolent sneer that
brought all the blood to Barbara's face, and caused the
more fiery portion of the assembly to half-draw their
blades. "Yes; for the truth is," he continued, glancing
defiantly around, "Czernova never had any such Charter
as is commonly alleged. How the first so-called Prince of
Czernova contrived to impose upon Russia the fiction of
a Charter granted by Catherine is indeed inexplicable;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
nevertheless the council of the empire has received ample
proof that such document has never existed."</p>

<p>Barbara's lifted hand quelled the wrathful murmurs.</p>

<p>"And without such Charter," she said, "it necessarily
follows that&mdash;will you finish the sentence for me, Count?"</p>

<p>"It follows that Czernova is as much a part of the
Czar's dominions as the rest of Russian Poland."</p>

<p>"Proceed a step farther, Count. Say that in reigning
over Czernova I have become liable to a charge of treason
in having usurped the authority of the Czar."</p>

<p>"His Majesty will permit you to plead ignorance."</p>

<p>"We commend his sweet graciousness. But I can
claim the word of the Czar himself that I am the lawful
ruler of Czernova, inasmuch as you, his chosen representative,
have greeted me with the title of 'Princess' and
'Highness.' If you now deny what you have previously
affirmed; if you now declare it to be treason to acknowledge
me as princess&mdash;then you have caused the Czar to
be guilty of treason against the Czar! Truly, Sir Envoy,
you conduct your embassy in strange and perplexing
fashion, and we would pray you to be more clear of
speech. For as touching your allegation that the Charter
never had existence, by your own mouth are you contradicted,
seeing that you yourself have cited from that
Charter the words of the Czernovese coronation oath.
Are we now to understand that in your desire to exclude
me from the throne, you did not scruple to quote from a
mythical document?"</p>

<p>Surely no ambassador can ever have blundered more
than Orloff! He was evidently better qualified to bully a
regiment or to preside at a knouting than to conduct
diplomatic negotiations. Thick-skinned as he was, he felt
the sting of Barbara's remarks, and his great face reddened.
He had thought to gain an easy victory over a
young girl, whereas it was now clear that in this contest
of the tongue, the princess was decidedly his superior.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Zabern smiled grimly, much regretting that Katina was
not present to be a witness of her enemy's humiliation.</p>

<p>"In using the terms 'Princess' and 'Charter,'" said
Orloff, "be it understood that my language was provisional."</p>

<p>"And so," said Barbara, with sovereign disdain curving
her lips, "it would seem that for fifty years Czernova
has been enjoying its freedom by virtue of false statements.
Marvellous that during all this time Russia has
never once raised her voice in protest! Truly it says but
little for the wisdom of her statesmen in thus permitting
themselves to be duped for a period of half a century!
But we would draw the Czar's attention to a decree of the
Congress of Vienna, and worded thus: 'The principality
of Czernova shall be governed according to the
Charter granted by Catherine the Second; and Russia,
Austria, and Prussia are herewith empowered to uphold
the provisions of the same.' That Congress must have
had reason for believing in the existence of the Charter,
else how could they have spoken thus? In the face of
that decree is the Czar so ill-counselled as to deny the existence
of the historic Czernovese Charter?"</p>

<p>"That is his attitude, and nothing but its production in
my presence will set his doubts at rest."</p>

<p>"Marshal Zabern is the Warden of the Charter. He
can quickly prove that there is such a document preserved
in the Eagle Tower."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, your Highness, not in the Eagle Tower,"
observed Zabern. "When your Highness appointed me
Warden of the Charter, I had the document removed to&mdash;to&mdash;well,
for obvious reasons I prefer to keep its
place of deposit a secret. The document you refer to in
the iron coffer of the Eagle Tower is a copy merely."</p>

<p>The natural unaffected way in which Zabern spoke
almost imposed upon Paul himself. It certainly imposed
upon Orloff. Never did human countenance change so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
quickly as did that of the envoy at this moment,&mdash;the
moment of his anticipated triumph.</p>

<p>The Charter in the Eagle Tower a transcript merely,
and not the great original! Then his plot had resulted
only in the destruction of a worthless document. Czernova
stood as firm as ever!</p>

<p>Orloff's mortification found a reflection in the face of
Bora. Paul marked them both, and never did falsehood
give him such pleasure as the falsehood told by Zabern.</p>

<p>"After such testimony on the part of the marshal,"
observed Barbara, "you will no longer doubt."</p>

<p>"Then I am to understand," said Orloff, "that you
refuse to permit the Czar's envoy to inspect the Charter?"</p>

<p>"The Czar exceeds his authority in making such demand,"
replied Barbara with dignity. "By the decree
of the Congress of Vienna, Austria and Prussia are
equally concerned in this matter of the Charter. They
have not yet called its existence in question. To a joint
embassy from the three Powers doubt not that we shall
pay due regard."</p>

<p>Barbara's attitude in thus associating the courts of
Vienna and Berlin with that of St. Petersburg upon the
point at issue was diplomatically correct, as Orloff very
well knew. Unless the two other states should act in concert
with Russia, the latter had no power to compel Czernova
to produce its Charter. And it was quite within the
range of probability that Austria and Prussia, from motives
of political jealousy, would decline to co-operate in
an affair from which Russia alone was to gain.</p>

<p>Therefore, reflecting upon all this, Orloff began to perceive
that his plot for the destruction of the Charter, even
granting that it had been successfully carried out, was by
no means so decisive a blow as he had at first been led to
suppose. Czernova might be without its title to autonomy,
but this difficulty remained&mdash;how were the Czar's
ministry to establish the fact?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>A gleam of cunning suddenly appeared on the face of
the envoy. He had solved the problem.</p>

<p>"Is it not a part of the coronation-ritual," he asked,
"that the original Charter of Catherine shall be placed
upon the altar, and that the ruler of Czernova with hand
laid upon it shall swear to maintain its provisions?"</p>

<p>"That is so," responded the princess; "and we especially
invite you, Count, to a seat in the chancel in order
that you may witness the ceremony, and set your doubts
at rest."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly avail myself of the privilege offered
me," said Orloff with a peculiar smile, incomprehensible
to Barbara, but perfectly understood by at least two persons
present.</p>

<p>Fear fell upon Paul, if not upon Zabern. Though it
might be easy now to equivocate, and to devise plausible
excuses for withholding the Charter from the envoy's
view, yet on the great day of the coronation, the day that
should be the brightest in Barbara's life, the fatal truth
would have to be revealed. How was it possible to replace
the vital document that had been destroyed by fire!</p>

<p>"I have discharged my embassy," said Orloff, bowing.</p>

<p>"Count Radzivil," observed Barbara, turning to the
premier, "on you devolves the honor of entertaining our
guest, Count Feodor Orloff, so long as he shall remain
in Czernova."</p>

<p>But the envoy, his asperity not at all softened by the
princess's courtesy, bluntly averred his intention of setting
out for St. Petersburg within an hour from that time.</p>

<p>"Loyalty to the Czar forbids me to dally in his service."</p>

<p>"The Czar is honored in possessing an envoy so discreet.
My lords, we will retire."</p>

<p>Zabern was the first to draw his sabre, and to hold it
aloft over the head of Barbara; the rest of her adherents
standing in a double line imitated his action, Paul among
the number; and thus the fair sovereign, with a smile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
and a blush, and yet maintaining an air of dignity withal,
passed out beneath an arcade of brilliant sword-blades,
and amid a saluting cry from her soldiery of "Long live
the Princess of Czernova!"</p>

<p>She had gained a diplomatic victory over Russia, but
none knew better than Barbara herself that her triumph
was merely temporary, and that Russia would return to
the charge at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>The assembly broke up. Orloff went back to the Hôtel
de Varsovie, and summoning those of his suite who had
not attended him to the Vistula Palace, he set off immediately
for Russia. The Duke of Bora, with bitterness
rankling at his heart, followed the princess to her apartments,
determined to hear from her own lips whether it
was her intention to break off the marriage to which
she had been so long pledged. The ministers sought
the palace gardens, where they discussed the envoy's
defeat.</p>

<p>"The Czar will not submit to such rebuff," said Radzivil,
gloomily. "Yet how could the princess speak and
act otherwise if she must maintain her dignity?"</p>

<p>"Aha!" grinned Zabern to Paul, as they remained
behind in the Throne Hall. "Did you mark the two
traitors&mdash;the fall in their faces? They are somewhat
doubtful now as to the success of their plot. Orloff is
returning to Russia more than half-convinced that the
Charter is still intact."</p>

<p>"He has a lingering suspicion, however," remarked
Paul. "You have staved off the difficulty&mdash;but only for
a time. What will happen on the coronation-day when
Orloff beholds a charterless altar?"</p>

<p>"Bah! I'll remedy that," replied Zabern, adding as
he turned away, "shall I see you at the bal masque this
evening?"</p>

<p>"Without doubt," answered Paul; for had not Barbara
promised to dance with none but himself, a course she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
could take without exciting suspicion as to the relationship
existing between herself and her secretary, inasmuch
as her mask and fancy costume would disguise her
identity. "Without doubt," he continued, "for I am
young, which is to say, frivolous. But you, marshal, will
you be there? I thought you had a soul above music and
dancing?"</p>

<p>"And such have I. But the masquerade held this evening
by command of the princess is something more than a
mere <i>fête</i>; it is a cloak to cover a certain political enterprise&mdash;what,
you shall learn when the time comes. Captain
Woodville," added Zabern, mysteriously, "at the bal
masque of to-night history will be made. Till then, farewell."</p>

<p>With this Zabern turned away, and ascended to the
lofty chamber in which he had left Katina.</p>

<p>He opened the door, not without a certain fear that she
might have fulfilled her threat of suicide, but to his relief
he saw her sitting pensively beside the barred casement.
There was a pistol by her side, a weapon which
the marshal intuitively felt was a loaded one.</p>

<p>He had expected to be received with reproachful invective,
instead of which she met him with a glad light
in her eyes. She seemed totally transformed from the
vengeful maiden whom he had left an hour previously.
Zabern noted the change and wondered.</p>

<p>"Your imprisonment is over, Katina," he said, gently.
"Orloff has departed."</p>

<p>"I know it," she replied, "for I have seen him."</p>

<p>"You have seen him," muttered the marshal, glancing
suspiciously at the pistol, and doubtful now as to whether
it was loaded.</p>

<p>"Yes. In departing Orloff and his suite took their
way through the palace gardens and passed within view
of this very window. I could have over-reached you,
marshal," she continued with a smile, "for, as my pistol
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
is with me," she added, tapping the weapon, "I could
easily have brought him down."</p>

<p>"But the thought of Czernova stayed your hand?"</p>

<p>"No!" she answered, "no," murmuring the words
faintly, as if speaking more to herself than to him, while
at the same time the soft color mantled her cheek, "it was
the thought rather of him whom I love that kept me from
the deed."</p>

<p>"Him whom you love?" repeated Zabern, with a touch
of surprise in his voice. "Love? Humph! I am glad to
hear that word from you, Katina."</p>

<p>"Why so?" she asked, casting a glance at him, and
averting her eyes again immediately, when she observed
how steadfastly he was regarding her.</p>

<p>"It shows that you are human if you can be touched by
that sentiment," laughed Zabern. "I have been accustomed
to think that you were even as myself."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Insensible to love. You know that my father led me
in childhood to the sacramental altar, and there made me
swear to do my best to destroy a great empire. Complete
devotion to that patriotic vow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has extinguished in you every other emotion," murmured
Katina.</p>

<p>"True. <i>Delenda est Muscovia</i> is written on my heart
in letters of fire. Patriotism is the only passion that
has ever possessed me. But with youthful maiden it
should be different. Because Poland is not free must
you, too, steel your heart against natural affection?
And so my pretty Katina has a sweetheart? And his
name?"</p>

<p>Why Katina should look frightened, and why her face
should turn so white, completely mystified Zabern. As
she remained silent he repeated his last question.</p>

<p>"His name? No! I cannot tell it; at least&mdash;not&mdash;not
to you; though others know it. Nay," she added,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
wildly, "even Russakoff, the spy, can taunt me with it in
the public street."</p>

<p>"Others know it, even Russakoff?" repeated Zabern.
"And yet you would keep the name from me? Well, be
it so," he added reproachfully. "I should have thought,
Katina, that you would have let your old friend, the marshal,
be the first to congratulate you."</p>

<p>Strange that Zabern, so quick to divine the plans of his
enemies, should be so dull at reading a woman's heart!
Yet so it was. He really had not the least idea as to the
cause of Katina's agitation. He thought it behoved him
to find out. He had nursed her as a child on his knee, and
now with the tender familiarity of an old friend he placed
his hand beneath her chin, and though she attempted a
faint resistance, he succeeded in raising her drooping
face to his own. The strange wistful look in her dark
eyes that met his for a moment only, and then fell again,
was a complete revelation to the marshal. It told her
secret as clearly as if she had spoken it.</p>

<p>"Katina!" he murmured, huskily, quitting his hold of
her, and starting back.</p>

<p>Katina herself sank on a seat silently and with averted
face, the very picture of confusion.</p>

<p>"What! am I the man?"</p>

<p>If silence gives assent, then Katina had assented.</p>

<p>There was a brief interval of silence. Then the affair
seemed to present itself in a humorous light to the marshal,
for he began to laugh.</p>

<p>"You love me! Me! the greatest knave in Czernova!
a one-handed grim old fellow like myself, twice your age,
with an ugly face, made&mdash;thanks to the Russians!&mdash;still
more ugly by sabre-cuts. You have a strange taste,
Katina, when there is many a young and handsome Pole
willing to make you his bride."</p>

<p>"But none like Zabern," she murmured, yet hardly
daring to say the words.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>Though the marshal looked upon Katina as the fairest
maiden in Czernova after the princess, yet the thought
of wooing her had never entered his head; but now,
while he contemplated her as she trembled like a leaf,
looking the more charming in her confusion, the grim
old warrior felt within himself a power unfelt till that
moment.</p>

<p>"Katina," he said, and never before had she heard his
voice sound so gentle,&mdash;"Katina, you may kiss me&mdash;if
you like."</p>

<p>"It is your place to come and kiss me."</p>

<p>Zabern was making a forward movement, but ere he
could take the second step Katina was within his arms,
and clinging as if she intended never to release her hold.
And it was evident that the marshal found his new experiences
far more attractive than the business required
of him as a minister; for when a minute afterwards a
secretary tapped at the door with the announcement that
he was bringing state despatches, Zabern, in a loud voice,
bade him begone and carry the despatches to the&mdash;well,
a certain dark gentleman popularly supposed by the Muscovites
of Czernova to be a near relation of Zabern
himself.</p>

<p>"And have you never before loved any woman?" asked
Katina, as she sat on the marshal's knee, and seeming to
be quite at home there, too!</p>

<p>"Never; but now I shall love all women for your
sake."</p>

<p>"I had rather you did not," said Katina, opening wide
her eyes; and then as she nestled closer within his embrace
she murmured, "this is more pleasant than to hang
for the slaying of Orloff."</p>

<p>"Much more," remarked Zabern. "To shoot him
would have been a very inadequate retribution for what
he made you suffer. One swift pang, and all would have
been over. Now I will point out a better way of avenging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
yourself&mdash;a way that shall cause Orloff to eat out his
heart in vexation of spirit."</p>

<p>"But, Ladislas," answered Katina, for she had begun to
call the marshal by his Christian name: "Ladislas," she
repeated, with a pressure of his arms, "love has extinguished
the desire for vengeance."</p>

<p>"Humph! well, vengeance or no vengeance, there is a
certain work to be done, and a work, too, that must be
kept so secret that I dare not trust any one with the knowledge
of it, save you, my second self."</p>

<p>"If it be a task that can be performed by a woman,
let me be the one to do it."</p>

<p>"Good! Is not this little hand," said Zabern, raising
it to his lips as he spoke, "that can use pistol so well
equally skilled in handling the pen?"</p>

<p>"And how can my penmanship serve you?" asked
Katina, with wonder in her eyes. "Oh, I see," she continued,
with a mock pout, "you wish me to become your
secretary, and when I bring despatches to the door, you
will tell me to go to Satan, as you did to that poor fellow
just now."</p>

<p>"This is how your pen can aid me," said Zabern.
"Listen, while I reveal to you a state secret unknown
even to the princess and her cabinet."</p>

<p>And here the marshal proceeded to whisper his communication,
adding at its close, "Now you understand
the work I require of you?"</p>

<p>"O Ladislas, Ladislas," she said, gravely shaking
her head at him, "I believe you want to hang me, after
all."</p>

<p>"I have hanged men for similar work&mdash;true. But
this deed is a pardonable one, seeing that it is for the good
of the state. 'The end justifies the means'&mdash;that's
Cardinal Ravenna's maxim; and if a holy churchman
adopts that policy, why should not the profane Zabern
likewise? The plan I have suggested is the only way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
defeating the knavery of Orloff, and of saving Czernova
from the power of the Czar. Your hand is more expert
and delicate than mine, else would I not set it to this
task. I dare not entrust its execution to any other, for it
would be hazardous to admit a fourth person to the secret.
The knowledge of it must be confined to Katina, Captain
Woodville, and Zabern. You will do this?"</p>

<p>"I will do anything you ask of me," replied Katina,
simply.
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XII<br /><br />
THE POLISH CONSPIRACY</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>On the evening of the day that had witnessed the
envoy's defeat a masked ball was held, and the
halls and gardens of the Vistula Palace were
alive with gay revellers.</p>

<p>The centre of attraction was the spacious ball-room,
where, beneath golden chandeliers that shed a radiance
brighter than that of the sun, moved a crowd of Czernova's
noblest and fairest.</p>

<p>The picturesque character of the dresses, the glow of
color, the perfume of flowers, the gayety of the music,
and the rippling laughter of fair masqueraders, formed a
scene bewildering and intoxicating to the senses.</p>

<p>Amid this throng moved Paul Woodville in eager
quest of the masked Barbara, who had refrained from
telling him what costume she would assume. If he were
a true lover he ought to be able to penetrate her disguise,
she had playfully observed, and if he failed to discover
her, why then the want of discernment on his part should
bring its own punishment.</p>

<p>As he moved here and there witching glances were
cast at him by masked ladies, for as regards figure and
dress, few were more qualified than Paul to serve as a
cavalier.</p>

<p>He had adopted the old Polish costume. With a four-cornered
cap adorned by a waving heron plume, silken
"contuschi" that fell in graceful folds around well-shaped
limbs clad in tight silk hose, short boots decorated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
with gold lace, and a curved, diamond-hilted sabre swinging
lightly by his side, Paul walked among the men present,
the noblest figure of them all; and many whispering
inquiries were interchanged as to his identity.</p>

<p>At length Paul caught sight of a graceful figure, robed
in the silver-gray habit of a nun, standing solitary by the
entrance of a corridor leading from the ball-room.</p>

<p>He watched and saw her with a pretty shake of her
head repel in silence the addresses of three cavaliers in
succession.</p>

<p>As Paul drew near, the lady suddenly turned her head
and flashed a glance at him through the eyelet-holes of
her black silk vizard. That glance was sufficient, and in
another moment he was by her side.</p>

<p>"Fair lady," he whispered, "why this sad costume?"</p>

<p>"Is it not the garb of innocence?" returned the lady
in a low and obviously disguised voice.</p>

<p>"True, but it is also the negation of love."</p>

<p>"And why should I not frown upon love?"</p>

<p>"Because you would be gainsaying the vows you made
to me in the old Greek temple."</p>

<p>"Ah, Paul! you have discovered me," she whispered,
her lips smiling beneath the lace of her mask. "Now I,
in turn, will ask, 'Why this old Polish costume?'"</p>

<p>"I adopted what I thought would most please you."</p>

<p>"And it does please me," she replied with a tender
light in her eyes. "And it is suitable to the character of
the revelation you shall hear to-night. Come, we will
not dance just yet. Take me to the gardens, to the
Long Terrace."</p>

<p>Conscious of something odd in her manner, Paul,
drawing her arm within his own, conducted Barbara
from the brilliant ball-room to the quieter scene without,
and on reaching a retired corner of the marble terrace,
he seated her beside himself.</p>

<p>It was a lovely midsummer night. The air was pure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
and temperate, and alive with the plash and sparkle of
numerous fountains. The silver orb of the moon, set in
a dark-blue sky, and the colored lamps gleaming everywhere
among the foliage combined to produce a poetical
glamor that might have gladdened the eyes even of
Titania herself, the Queen of Fairyland.</p>

<p>"Who could have thought," said Paul, after complimenting
Barbara upon the admirable manner in which
she had out-man&oelig;uvred the Russian envoy, "who could
have thought when we first met in that Dalmatian forest
that a great empire would one day demand my extradition,
and that you would bravely refuse to grant it!"</p>

<p>"And I will not surrender you, Paul. No, not if it
should cost me my throne."</p>

<p>How sweet it was to hear such words from this fair
princess! She who was a match for the Czar's envoy to
set such store by him! This maiden pressing tenderly to
his side scarcely seemed to be the same person who that
morning had filled a throne with such dignity. Nor was
she. Love had entirely transfigured her.</p>

<p>"Paul," she said quietly, "I have told the duke that I
cannot marry him."</p>

<p>"How did he take the tidings?"</p>

<p>"He said little, but his face expressed much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Much&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Hatred, then, if you will have the word. Excluded
from the cabinet, and from the command of the army,
he is not likely to sit down quietly under such dishonoring.
And," she added with a sigh, "he is a political
force to be reckoned with."</p>

<p>"Sweet princess, give me leave to resume the duel with
him, and you shall soon be rid of one whom you seem to
fear."</p>

<p>"No, Paul, no," she said, laying her hand affectionately
upon his; "promise me that you will not fight with
him again."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>"Does the princess command?"</p>

<p>"No; your Barbara entreats," she said with a soft
pressure of her arm. Who could resist such an appeal
as this?</p>

<p>"I do not doubt your ability to overcome the duke,
for Zabern has told me of your feat in the <i>salle d'armes</i>;
but you forget that duelling is illegal in Czernova. Would
you have me send you to the Citadel? Moreover, if you
should slay the duke it would become the aim of every
Muscovite fanatic to slay you. As it is, I fear you will
carry your life in your hands, when men come to learn
that you are the cause of the duke's rejection. Czernova
is but semi-civilized, and assassination is the favorite
political weapon here. I would, Paul, that you would
do even as Zabern."</p>

<p>"And what is Zabern's habit?"</p>

<p>"He wears chain-mail beneath his clothing."</p>

<p>"An uncomfortable arrangement, I should say. For
my own part I will rely on my right arm and on my good
sword. Fear not for me. But, dearest Barbara, will you
not unmask, and let me see your face, if only for a
moment?"</p>

<p>She shook her head tantalizingly.</p>

<p>"I would if I dared, but who knows what eyes may be
watching me at this moment? There are Russian spies
at this masquerade, so Zabern assures me. I must not
be recognized in this guise. Ah! who comes here?"
Paul felt her arm trembling upon his, as there moved
slowly along the moonlit terrace a tall and stately figure
robed in a monastic habit. His cassock was identical in
its shade of gray with the nun's gown worn by Barbara,
and like hers, it was marked on each shoulder with a red
cross.</p>

<p>Having reached the place where Barbara sat, the monk
paused, surveyed her attentively for a moment, and then
spoke,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>"May a brother claim a few words from a sister of
the same order?"</p>

<p>"How know you that I am of the same order?"</p>

<p>"The 'Transfigured' cannot be hidden from each
other."</p>

<p>"Paul," she whispered, "I must speak with this man
alone for a short time. Remain here."</p>

<p>The princess arose, and in company with the newcomer
paced slowly to and fro along the terrace, repeatedly
passing Paul.</p>

<p>This proceeding on the part of Barbara was somewhat
strange, but not altogether incomprehensible. Paul
had learned that the word "Transfigured" was used by
the patriots of Czernova in the sense of one who, from
a state of despair as regards Poland, had passed to a
state of hope. Its English equivalent was "conspirator."
The term naturally associated itself with the
Convent of the Transfiguration, and hence Paul concluded
that this masked individual was a monk sent from
that very mysterious monastery with some important
message.</p>

<p>The conversation, of which he did not overhear one
word, occupied about fifteen minutes, and ended by the
monk passing some papers to the princess, who immediately
concealed them upon her person, an action performed
so quickly that Paul almost doubted whether it
had really taken place.</p>

<p>This transference of documents accomplished, the monk
glided quietly away, and the princess returned to the side
of Paul.</p>

<p>Ere he had time to question Barbara on the nature of
the interview, Paul saw with surprise a second masked
friar making his way along the terrace. He was robed
so precisely like the other that Paul at first thought it
was the same individual; but a nearer view showed that
he was of shorter and more massive build. There could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
be no doubt that he, too, was bent on having an interview
with the princess.</p>

<p>Was this sort of thing to last all night?</p>

<p>Barbara guessed his thoughts, and her teeth gleamed
in a pretty smile beneath the silken fringe of her vizard.</p>

<p>"Patience, Paul," she whispered. "This is the second
and last. There in the distance comes Marshal Zabern,
and as I must have no secrets from you he shall act as
my interpreter."</p>

<p>On the approach of the monk the same interchange of
words took place, evidently a pre-arranged signal, and,
as before, Barbara arose and joined in conversation with
the new-comer.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards another figure came upon the
scene whom, in spite of the mask and black domino, Paul
recognized as Zabern.</p>

<p>The marshal sat down by Paul's side and fixed his eyes
upon the princess, who, a little distance away, was stooping
over the balustrade of the terrace, apparently engaged
in the act of writing.</p>

<p>"What think you that the princess is now doing?"
asked Zabern.</p>

<p>"One might fancy her to be setting down the name of
a cavalier upon her dance-programme, but I suppose
such is not the case?"</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville," returned the marshal impressively,
"you are witnessing an event destined to change
the map of Europe in the near future. The princess is
signing a secret treaty with Louis Kossuth, the uncrowned
King of Hungary."</p>

<p>Paul's surprise and wonderment can be better imagined
than described.</p>

<p>"The princess has signified to me her wish that you
should be admitted to the circle of 'The Transfigured;'
and convinced as I am of your loyalty to her, I offer no
opposition, knowing that if you should not altogether approve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
of our policy, you will at least keep our secret.
It is our custom to exact an oath from initiates&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will vow upon the Four Evangelists&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Upon your sword if you must swear at all, as our
Polish chevaliers of old when at church they recited the
'Credo.' Our initiatory oath can be dispensed with in
your case. Your promise is sufficient. The word of
a soldier should be sacred. You pledge yourself to
secrecy?"</p>

<p>And when Paul had assented, the marshal continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Know, then, that Princess Natalie is at the head of a
secret enterprise,&mdash;'conspiracy' would be the Czar's
word,&mdash;an enterprise for the liberation of Poland from
the Russian yoke. The two monks are agents in this
affair. The first is a Pole bringing documents from the
headquarters of the patriots at Warsaw. The second
is a Hungarian from Buda charged with the secret treaty
from Kossuth. The masquerade of to-night was held
with a special view to their meeting the princess, no other
way being so well suited to divert suspicion; for with
spies all around us it behoves us to act with caution.
The traitor Bora, at this moment in the ball-room,
little knows what is happening only a stone's-throw
off."</p>

<p>"But what interest hath Hungary in this affair?"</p>

<p>"Hungary is herself preparing to revolt from the
despotic rule of the House of Hapsburg. Next spring
she will rise under Louis Kossuth, whose triumph is
certain. Hungary will again take her place among the
free nations of Europe. We in Czernova sympathize
with the Magyars, but as matters are at present we dare
not openly aid them with our army. Austria would cry
to the Czar, and the Czar, availing himself of the opportunity,
would lose no time in annexing Czernova. We
are thus necessitated to give our aid in secret. Money is
the sinews of war; we therefore lend the Hungarians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
money on the understanding that they in turn shall aid
us when the day of Poland comes."</p>

<p>"And how much are you advancing?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and eighty million roubles; not paper
money, mark you, but sterling gold in coinage and plate."</p>

<p>The vastness of the sum&mdash;thirty millions in English
money&mdash;filled Paul with amazement.</p>

<p>"How has Czernova contrived to raise such a large
amount?"</p>

<p>"But small part of it comes from Czernova. It represents
the free-will offerings of Polish patriots throughout
the world for a long course of years. Noble ladies have
given their jewellery, the peasant his kopek, ay, often his
last kopek, to the good cause."</p>

<p>"And where is this treasure stored?"</p>

<p>"In the Convent of the Transfiguration. Yes," continued
Zabern, "we aid Hungary, and Hungary will aid
us when the great day of vengeance shall come."</p>

<p>"And when will that be?"</p>

<p>"'Russia's danger is Poland's opportunity,'&mdash;that is
the Czernovese motto. We are waiting till Russia shall
be engaged in war with England."</p>

<p>"Is such war likely to occur?"</p>

<p>"It is a certain event of the near future. In the School
of Naval Engineers at Sebastopol," said Zabern, beginning
a statement, whose relevancy Paul failed at first to
perceive, "is a complete representation of all the forts
that line the Bosphorus with their towers and bastions,
together with the most minute details respecting the
creeks and currents of that famous strait; so that the
Russian War Minister sitting at Sebastopol with these
models before him could direct the whole plan of an attack
upon Constantinople."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Imperative orders have just been issued from St.
Petersburg commanding the naval captains to study these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
models; lectures upon them are given daily to the naval
cadets. Bearing in mind Alexander's saying to Napoleon,
'<i>Il faut avoir les clefs de notre maison dans la
poche</i>,' what inference do you draw?"</p>

<p>"That Russia is preparing to seize the Sultan's
dominions?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. Will England permit this?"</p>

<p>"Not while 'Old Pam' is living."</p>

<p>"'Old Pam'?" said Zabern, puzzled till Paul explained.
"Ah! your grand Lord Palmerston, the friend of oppressed
nationalities! Well, then, we shall soon have an
Anglo-Russian war. Your gallant armies and fleets will
be seen ere long off the shores of the Baltic and Euxine.
My faith in the bravery of your countrymen enables me
to prophesy that they will be victorious. And then will
come the day of our triumph!"</p>

<p>The patriotic Zabern, whose days from boyhood had
been spent in struggling for the freedom of his fatherland,
was now fully convinced that success was at hand.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, his eye kindling with enthusiasm;
"yes, in the hour of Russia's humiliation, when
her treasury is exhausted and her armies demoralized by
defeat, there will be an upheaval of Poland; no feeble
flash-in-the-pan this time, but a grand national uprising,
north, south, east, and west. Little Czernova will be to
the fore with her army of twenty thousand under Zabern;
the Magyars of Hungary will pour across the border
with Kossuth at their head; there will be a combination
such as will compel Russia to part with the kingdom she
wickedly stole fifty years ago. When I was born Poland
was free; I shall die seeing her free again. And the
princess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the princess?" inquired Paul, as Zabern
paused in his utterance.</p>

<p>"Will be a princess no longer. The patriots have
agreed that Natalie Lilieska, as the sole surviving descendant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
of the ancient Jagellons, shall be the queen of
resuscitated Poland. Queen? ay, and why not empress?
Is she not worthy of an imperial crown?"</p>

<p>Paul's head fairly swam at these words. The sweet,
fair, dark-haired maiden who loved him, and who clung
to him with such touching fidelity, a future queen&mdash;empress!
He knew that Barbara would never waver in her
attachment to him; to what dazzling heights, then, was
he destined to rise?</p>

<p>He glanced at the two gray moonlit figures in the distance&mdash;the
monk and the nun&mdash;conspiring for the creation
of a kingdom. How romantically impossible seemed
this scheme looked at beforehand! and yet how many of
the noblest events in history have been previously declared
impossible by political prophets!</p>

<p>"As touching your secret treasure," remarked Paul,
"is there not a bill before the Diet,&mdash;a bill to seize all
monastic wealth and to convert it to state purposes?"</p>

<p>"At this very moment the Diet is putting its veto upon
the measure. To-night was fixed for the second reading.
Our Polish adherents are assembled in full force to reject
it. After to-night we shall hear no more of Lipski's
bill. It would be an ill day for us if it should pass.
Ostensibly directed against Czernovese monasteries in
general, it is really aimed at the Convent of the Transfiguration.
The Czerno-Muscovites have a suspicion
that the monks of that establishment do other things besides
offering perpetual prayers for Poland, and the suspicion
is well founded. If public commissioners enter
that monastery they will discover not only our store of
gold, but likewise the documents relating to our patriotic
conspiracy; and more than these, plans and models of
Russian fortresses, supplied by our adherents in the
Czar's army, who are not a few. The convent contains
arms for one hundred thousand men, gunpowder sufficient
to blow up all Czernova, and in addition new military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
engines. Some of the inmates of that convent
devote their time to chemistry and mechanics; and in
the coming struggle betwixt Poland and Russia we shall
have the first use of inventions destined to revolutionize
the old-fashioned methods of warfare. In the light of
these inventions the numbers of our enemy will count for
little. Now you understand why the Convent of the
Transfiguration must be kept from the eyes of prying
intruders."</p>

<p>"I likewise grasp the meaning of that passage in Orloff's
cipher despatch,&mdash;'The success of Lipski's bill is
Russia's justification.'"</p>

<p>"I admit the truth of the statement. The secrets of
that convent, if brought to the light of day, would prove
that the resources of Czernova are being utilized for the
emancipation of Poland. And have we not the right to
attempt the recovery of the kingdom stolen from our
forefathers? Nevertheless, in the opinion of European
statesmen fettered by conventional precedents, our aim
would amply justify the Czar in annexing the principality.
Therefore Lipski's bill must not pass."</p>

<p>At this juncture Barbara, having finished her interview,
returned to the side of Paul; Zabern, desirous of
a word with the Hungarian envoy, went forward to intercept
his departure.</p>

<p>"So Zabern has told you of our enterprise? What
think you, Paul?"</p>

<p>"May the crown of Poland indeed be yours, Barbara.
And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;the higher you climb the greater
the gulf between us."</p>

<p>"You shall rise with me, Paul," she said, placing her
hand tenderly within his. "You, who gained fame in
India, shall gain a greater fame in the coming war, and
then there will be no obstacle to our union. 'Let the
princess marry merit and not title,' men will say."</p>

<p>This gave a new aspect to their love-affair,&mdash;an aspect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
which appealed to Paul's dashing and adventurous
spirit; like the knights of a bygone age he would fight
both for the winning of fame and also for the hand of a
lovely princess. If the patriotic conspiracy should end
in failure, alas! for Barbara's hopes, but so much the better
for his prospect of a final union with her. His good
fortune, he trusted, would enable him to emerge safely
from the political ruins of Czernova, and with Barbara
he would retire to his ancestral hall in Kent, where they
would spend the rest of their days in quiet happiness,
and recall with melancholy pleasure the time when they
had plotted and fought for the crown of Poland.</p>

<p>Zabern, having parted from the Hungarian messenger,
sat down on the other side of the princess, and for a long
time the trio talked of the conspiracy. Among other
matters, Paul learned that Katina was cognizant of the
conspiracy, and that all the cabinet likewise were participants,
with the exception of the two permanent
members&mdash;Cardinal Ravenna and Mosco the Greek
Archpastor.</p>

<p>"I can understand your Highness's motive in keeping
our enterprise concealed from a Muscovite prelate," remarked
Zabern; "but with regard to Ravenna is not the
case different? He would be extremely useful to us in
drawing the Catholic clergy of Poland into the plot."</p>

<p>"Marshal," said Barbara firmly, "I know the cardinal,
and I know that he is not to be trusted."</p>

<p>Their attention was diverted at this point by the approach
of two masked figures, each habited, like Zabern,
in a black domino.</p>

<p>"Radzivil and Dorislas returning from the Diet," observed
the marshal. The premier and his colleague recognized
the princess and Zabern by their costumes, but
glanced inquiringly at Paul, uncertain as to his identity.</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville, my lords," replied Barbara, responsive
to their thoughts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>Paul drew aside, permitting Radzivil to take a place
beside Barbara, a courtesy which the premier gracefully
acknowledged.</p>

<p>Dorislas with folded arms leaned in silence against the
marble balustrade of the terrace. As far as can be judged
of men who are masked and cloaked, both the premier
and the finance minister were in a very gloomy mood.
Paul intuitively felt that they were the bearers of bad
tidings.</p>

<p>"Has your Highness signed the treaty with Kossuth?"
began Radzivil.</p>

<p>"An hour ago. The Hungarian envoy has departed
with it."</p>

<p>"I fear, princess, that the treaty will have to be rescinded.
We are doomed to lose our treasure."</p>

<p>"Say not so, count. The Catholic Poles form the
majority in the Diet; why should they desert both their
princess and their religion?"</p>

<p>"This evening, as your Highness knows," explained
the premier, "there took place the second reading of the
Secular Appropriation Bill. During the course of the
debate Lipski presented to the House certain statistics
appraising the wealth contained in the various monasteries
of Czernova. These statistics were, of course,
purely imaginary&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For," intervened Dorislas, "if he knew the whole
truth concerning the Convent of the Transfiguration he
would have put the amount at four times his actual
estimate."</p>

<p>"Just so," responded Radzivil, a melancholy smile
appearing beneath his mask. "Well, he attempted to
prove by means of these statistics that the monastic
wealth would enable Czernova to be tax-free for the next
three years. The House eagerly caught at the bait. All
the Muscovite faction voted with Lipski as a matter of
course; and many of our side, charmed with the idea of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
a three years' remission of taxation, likewise cast their
suffrages in favor of the bill. The members of our party
do not know the reason why the ministry are so anxious
to throw the ægis of their protection over the convents,
and, of course, we dare not take them into our confidence.
The result is, and with extreme regret I announce it to
your Highness, that the second reading of the Appropriation
Bill has been carried by a majority of eleven."</p>

<p>"Ha!" muttered Zabern to himself. "Orloff's gold is
doing its work."</p>

<p>"Was there a full house?" asked Barbara.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, every member of the Opposition was
present; and on our side there were but three absentees,&mdash;the
marshal, the cardinal, and the duke."</p>

<p>"The duke?" said Barbara. "I fear that his vote
will be given against us now, which will raise the majority
to twelve. The marshal's vote and the cardinal's
would reduce it to ten. When does the third reading
take place?"</p>

<p>"It has been fixed for this day week."</p>

<p>"Ten votes against us," murmured the princess. "The
transference of six votes from the opposite side would
place us in a majority of two. My lords, we must win
over those six votes, if no more."</p>

<p>"I fail to see how it's to be done," commented Radzivil
gloomily.</p>

<p>Silence fell upon the little group. Truly, with the
Charter destroyed, and with Lipski's bill on the eve of
triumphing, Barbara's throne was in desperate jeopardy.</p>

<p>"Cannot your Highness refuse to sign the bill?"
asked Paul.</p>

<p>"By the terms of the Charter," replied Barbara, "the
ruler of Czernova is compelled to sign every bill passed
by the Diet. In the event of refusal the Diet has the
right of calling upon Russia, Austria, and Prussia, to
enforce the signature."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>"And Lipski and his Muscovite crew would not be
slow in appealing to them," remarked Dorislas. "And
we know what the intervention of the three Powers
would mean."</p>

<p>"If I should dissolve the Diet, and order a fresh election&mdash;?"
began Barbara.</p>

<p>"We should have the same majority against us," replied
Radzivil.</p>

<p>"Insert a clause in the bill," suggested Paul, "to the
effect that the Convent of the Transfiguration shall be
exempted from the operation of the bill."</p>

<p>"Useless," answered the premier, "since that convent
is the one particularly aimed at."</p>

<p>"A clause giving her Highness sole power to appoint
the Commissioners."</p>

<p>Dorislas grinned.</p>

<p>"I moved that amendment myself, but it was rejected."</p>

<p>"Play Cromwell's game: on the day of the voting
station troopers at the doors of the Diet-house to exclude
obnoxious members; or the night before carry some off
and detain them till the voting is over."</p>

<p>"Unconstitutional," said Barbara. "To secure the
rejection of the bill by such methods would be to court
the intervention of the three Powers."</p>

<p>"Secretly withdraw the documents and the treasure
from the convent."</p>

<p>"With soldiers patrolling the precincts?" said Dorislas.
"Lipski, subtle knave that he is, has artfully
turned our own bayonets against us. Every one passing
out of the convent is carefully searched."</p>

<p>"Bribe the soldiers."</p>

<p>"Lipski is alive to that man&oelig;uvre. Day and night
his creatures are watching that monastery."</p>

<p>"Let the monks, then, bury the arms and the treasure
within their own walls."</p>

<p>"Lipski, who is certain to be appointed one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Commissioners, will dig up every foot of ground and pull
down every brick in his endeavors to discover something
of disadvantage to the ministry," returned Dorislas.</p>

<p>Paul made no more suggestions; how, indeed, could he,
when it passed the wit of the premier himself to devise a
plan adequate for defeating the man&oelig;uvres of Lipski?</p>

<p>"If the bill should pass," continued Dorislas, "I see
but one way out of our difficulty. The monks must contrive
to steal out some dark night, leaving a slow match
burning in the powder-magazine."</p>

<p>"And we must lose the fruit of years?" said the princess,
mournfully.</p>

<p>"Why, your Highness, consider what would happen
otherwise. Here, close to the Russian frontier, and commanding
the highroad to Warsaw, is an edifice, presumably
a monastery, but in reality a fortress and an arsenal.
True, Abbot Faustus can destroy the treasonable documents;
yet, nevertheless, here will be found, because impossible
to be annihilated or concealed, a vast store of
gold, rifles for one hundred thousand men, and other
war <i>matériel</i>. Vain would it be for the Czernovese ministry
to put an innocent interpretation upon their attempts
to keep the interior workings of this convent from public
view. The Czar would be wanting in common sense if
he should not see in all this a menace to his own dominions.
His ministers, in fact, already have their suspicions,
and hence they are more eager than Lipski himself
for the passing of the Appropriation Bill."</p>

<p>"I note that the marshal has not yet spoken," smiled
Barbara; "sure proof that he is developing some plan.
Now, Zabern, your enemies call you 'the Asp of Czernova';
you must maintain your character for serpentine
wisdom by extricating us from our dilemma."</p>

<p>"Fear not, your Highness. Lipski shall not triumph.
On the third reading I, without resorting to bribery,
threats, or violence, will persuade the Diet to reject his
bill."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>"How?" asked Radzivil, who, desirous as he was of
seeing the measure defeated, yet nevertheless felt aggrieved
that Zabern should propose to do what he himself,
the premier, despaired of doing; "how? what is
your plan?"</p>

<p>"To reveal it beforehand would ensure its defeat. My
plan is one which requires absolute concealment."</p>

<p>"Even from the princess?" said Barbara.</p>

<p>"From the princess most of all," replied Zabern with
a peculiar smile.</p>

<p>This statement was naturally productive of great surprise
on the part of Barbara.</p>

<p>"We will accept your saying, marshal, though a hard
one, and put a check upon our curiosity. You have never
yet failed to keep word with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And shall not fail now, your Highness."</p>

<p>"Then," said Barbara, rising, as there came floating
on the air from the ball-room the slow, dreamy music
of a Hungarian waltz, "then if Zabern be on the watch,
the princess may dance. Captain Woodville, your arm.
You were promised a dance. Let me redeem my word.
But first, marshal, guard these papers for me. It would
be dangerous to let them fall upon the ball-room floor."</p>

<p>And Barbara, having handed to Zabern the documents
which she had received from the Polish envoy, moved
off towards the ball-room leaning upon the arm of
Paul.</p>

<p>This bestowal of favor upon her secretary caused Radzivil
and Dorislas to stare suspiciously at each other; but
ere they could interchange thought on the matter, their
attention was diverted by the sound of many voices
coming from the direction contrary to that taken by the
princess.</p>

<p>Looking up, the three ministers beheld moving along
the terrace towards them a company of masqueraders,
ladies and gentlemen, fancifully costumed. All were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
laughing and talking gayly, being evidently in the best
of spirits.</p>

<p>"Whom have we here?" muttered Radzivil, eying
the throng.</p>

<p>"He who would supplant the princess in the sovereignty,"
replied Zabern, recognizing the central figure,
who was garbed as Peter the Great. "A barbarian
aping a barbarian."</p>

<p>"The Duke of Bora?"</p>

<p>"The same, surrounded by his favorites and satellites,
all jubilant with the thought that Lipski's bill will triumph,
and that the fall of the princess is at hand. Let
them laugh. Their gayety will turn to mortification after
next week's vote shall have been taken. Let us uncover
and tempt the traitor to address us. I am curious to
learn what he will say."</p>

<p>As the duke and his friends drew near the trio unmasked.
Bora, catching sight of them, stopped in his
walk, and then came slowly forward attended by his
followers, all intent on enjoying the presumable mortification
of the ministers.</p>

<p>"A sad blow this, dear marshal, to the feelings of the
princess," began the duke blandly, and lighting a cigar
as he spoke. "It's quite certain that the Appropriation
Bill will pass."</p>

<p>"Pass? Oh! dear no. Nothing of the sort," replied
Zabern in his most cheerful manner.</p>

<p>"We have just been informed that the second reading
has been carried by a majority of 'eleven.'"</p>

<p>"The third reading has yet to come."</p>

<p>"Now, Saint Nicholas give you wisdom!" cried Bora,
amid the scarcely repressed laughter of his creatures.
"Are you clinging to the hope that the men who voted
one thing to-night will vote the contrary seven days
hence?"</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> that they will," returned Zabern, coolly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>"There is certain to be a full House next week&mdash;one
hundred and twenty members, should Ravenna have
returned from Rome in time to take part in the division.
Out of that number I venture to prophesy that seventy
will be found to reject the bill."</p>

<p>"Giving the ministry a majority of twenty?"</p>

<p>"Giving the ministry a majority of twenty," repeated
Zabern.</p>

<p>Bora could only attribute this utterance to mere
bravado.</p>

<p>"Marshal, I should like to know with what amount
you will back your opinion," he sneered.</p>

<p>"With whatever sum your grace is prepared to back
yours."</p>

<p>"I will stake five thousand roubles&mdash;" began the duke.</p>

<p>"Oh! your grace, make it more than that," said Zabern
affably.</p>

<p>"I will double the amount. I will wager ten thousand
roubles that the votes given against the bill will fall short
of seventy."</p>

<p>"Let me have that wager in your handwriting, dear
duke," said Zabern blandly. "The like sum from me if
ministers have not seventy votes on their side, or a clear
majority of twenty."</p>

<p>When the written pledges had been interchanged Radzivil
spoke, addressing the duke in somewhat indignant
tones.</p>

<p>"And do you bet, then, on the success of a measure
known to be hateful to the princess?"</p>

<p>Bora shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"This is a bill on which the best of friends may differ,
as is shown by the schism among your own Polish adherents.
Remember," he added, "there must be no underhand
work to secure the passing of this bill, or my
wager becomes null and void. There must be no bribery
on the part of the ministry."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>"We leave bribery to Lipski and his principal, Orloff;
or shall I put the word in the plural, your grace, and say
principals," said Zabern with a meaning smile.</p>

<p>Bora gave a slight start, which did not escape the
other's notice.</p>

<p>"You see, dear duke," drawled Zabern airily, "we
know all that is going on behind the scenes. Governor
Orloff in his palace at Warsaw pulls the strings, and the
puppets dance in the Diet of Slavowitz. Next week I
shall manipulate the strings, and you shall see the figures
dancing to my tune."</p>

<p>The duke began to grow somewhat uneasy under the
knowledge displayed by Zabern. In his previous contests
with the wily Pole he had always come off second-best.
Was Zabern again to triumph over him?</p>

<p>"You talk boldly, marshal," he said with a supercilious
smile, "but I think I shall win my roubles."</p>

<p>So saying he passed on with his company.</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered Radzivil, gloomily, "it's quite
clear that, vexed with the princess for excluding him
from the cabinet, he will now throw in his lot with the
Opposition."</p>

<p>"Therein appearing in his true colors," replied Zabern.
"There he walks, a would-be sovereign, attended
by a would-be court. <i>Carpe diem, Bora, carpe diem!</i>
Enjoy your brief span of existence! The 15th of September
next will see your end."</p>

<p>"The 15th of September?" repeated Dorislas. "That
is the day of the princess's coronation."</p>

<p>"True; and if I rightly forecast the future, Dorislas,
the duke will not outlive that day."
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XIII<br /><br />
THE FATE OF THE APPROPRIATION BILL</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<p>By a singular turn of circumstances the day on
which the fate of the Appropriation Bill was to be
decided, and possibly with that bill the fate of
Czernova itself, was likewise the day appointed for the
annual review of the Czernovese army.</p>

<p>This marshalling of troops took place in a spacious
plain a few miles to the north of Slavowitz, and was presided
over by the princess herself.</p>

<p>The muster fell considerably short of that of the previous
year, due to the fact that many of the troops were
engaged in the duty of keeping guard over the numerous
monasteries of Czernova.</p>

<p>Still, in spite of absentee regiments, the review was a
fine sight, even in the eyes of Paul, accustomed as he was
to much more striking displays. His frequent expressions
of admiration gave pleasure to Barbara, who had
been somewhat dreading his criticism, anticipating that
he, as a tried soldier, might disparage the merits of an
army, whose mettle had never yet been tested in actual
battle.</p>

<p>A peculiar and significant feature of the scene was the
proximity of the Convent of the Transfiguration, which
overlooked the place of the review. Barbara's landau was
drawn up almost within the shadow of its gray Gothic
towers.</p>

<p>The weird chant of the monks, that dirge which had
never ceased day or night for fifty years, was clearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
audible, mingling with the more stirring and martial
sounds without, and contributing to impress Paul with
the curious character of Czernovese civilization.</p>

<p>The precincts of this convent were patrolled by sentinels
whom the Diet had sent thither to prevent any removal
of monastic treasures on the part of ecclesiastics
who might feel tempted to evade the provisions of the
pending bill.</p>

<p>With bayonets flashing in the sunshine, the sentries
paced slowly to and fro, their presence grimly reminding
the princess that there was a greater than herself in Czernova,
to wit, the Diet. That legislature, regardless of her
wish in the matter, might that very night pass a measure
destined to disclose the secrets of a conspiracy of which
she was the head.</p>

<p>Nothing had occurred during the course of the week
to lead to the opinion that the Diet would change their
views respecting the Appropriation Bill; on the contrary,
judging from the tenor of the debates, it seemed probable
that the majority in its favor would be increased on the
third and final reading.</p>

<p>No wonder then, that, though she smiled pleasantly
upon each regiment in the grand march past, winning all
hearts by her gracious demeanor, Barbara nevertheless
felt a terrible depression of spirit at the thought of the
coming night,&mdash;a depression which all Zabern's assurances
could not remove.</p>

<p>The review being over, the princess and her suite set
off for Slavowitz. Paul and Radzivil sat side by side in
the same landau with Barbara, while Zabern rode in the
rear at the head of a troop of horse.</p>

<p>About a mile from the scene of the review the road for
a considerable distance was bordered on each side by
thick woods.</p>

<p>As the carriage rolled on, the postilions beheld in the
distance two men by the wayside sitting upon the trunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
of a fallen tree. They were fellows of rough appearance,
seemingly woodmen or charcoal-burners; one, with a
black beard, was holding a newspaper in his hand and
apparently reading from it, while his companion, a red-bearded
individual, seemed to be listening.</p>

<p>When the princess's landau was a few yards distant,
these two men sprang to their feet with startling quickness,
and then it was seen that the red-bearded fellow held
a revolver in his hand. Raising the weapon he pointed it
at the princess, and took aim so quickly that the postilions
had not time to raise a warning cry.</p>

<p>Barbara, though her face was set in the direction of her
would-be assassin, saw nothing of his action, being occupied
at the time in an animated conversation with the
premier.</p>

<p>One shot whizzed its flight clean through the brim of
her hat; a second bullet sang past her temple so closely
as to scorch her skin with its fiery glow.</p>

<p>Then as if overcome by sudden terror at the boldness of
their deed, or possibly fearful lest the advancing cavalry
should prevent their escape, the two men turned, without
waiting to see whether the shots had taken effect, and
plunged into the woodland bordering the roadside just as
Zabern's voice was heard thundering the word, "Fire!"</p>

<p>A dozen carbines rang out simultaneously, but the
discharge came a second too late.</p>

<p>Paul and Radzivil, sitting with back to the horses,
knew nothing of what was passing, till informed by the
report of the firearms, and by the sudden change that
came over Barbara's face, for the sight of two men running
away, one of whom carried a smoking pistol, apprised
her of the peril she had escaped.</p>

<p>"Princess, you are not hurt?" cried the premier, looking
far more terrified than Barbara herself.</p>

<p>"No," she answered in a faint voice, but with a smile,
"they have missed me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" said Paul. "Count, remain with
the princess while I give chase to the villains."</p>

<p>The startled postilions had reined in their horses,
bringing the landau to a standstill. Paul sprang from the
vehicle just as Zabern with the guards came galloping up,
witnesses of the deed which they had been unable to
prevent.</p>

<p>Perceiving that the contiguity of the trees prevented
the passage of their horses, the troopers flung themselves
from the saddle, and dashed after Paul, who had now disappeared
in the woodland. Foremost among them was
Zabern with his orderly Nikita.</p>

<p>Plunging along a narrow path thick-set on each side
with leafy boscage, Paul caught sight of the two retreating
figures a few yards only in front of him. They were
running in single file, their running being of a somewhat
singular character, and very like the leaping of a kangaroo,
the cause of which Paul soon divined.</p>

<p>He had drawn out his pistol, and while still forging
ahead he took aim at the rearmost figure, but the shot
flew aloft almost perpendicularly, for in the very act of
firing he stumbled over some hidden obstacle.</p>

<p>Though dazed by concussion with the hard earth he
was instantly on his feet again, observant of the fact that
the two men had now disappeared round a bend in the
path. He dashed swiftly onward, but had scarcely taken
a dozen steps when he was once more brought to earth
by the same sort of contrivance that had caused his previous
fall.</p>

<p>The desperadoes had taken precautions to secure their
retreat. Strong wires at irregular distances, placed at
the necessary height, and concealed by the profusion of
weeds and bracken, had been drawn transversely across
the path from tree to tree. The contrivers of this device,
aware of the exact position of the wires, had cleared them
by a series of leaps, and hence their kangaroo-like
motions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>Those following Paul were tripped up in similar manner
by the wires which, spread over a distance of about a hundred
yards, retarded the pursuit, and enabled the fugitives
to obtain a good start.</p>

<p>At a point a little way beyond the last wire the path
branched off in three directions through the wood, and a
momentary halt took place on the part of the pursuers,
doubtful as to which track they should take, since the
fugitives themselves were lost to view.</p>

<p>The quick eye of Zabern detected a bright-colored
object lying a few feet away down the left-hand path. It
proved to be a red cap, decorated with a paltry leaden
medal of the Czar, a cap declared by Nikita to have been
worn by the black-bearded individual.</p>

<p>"Then, forward," cried Zabern, taking the lead.
"They have fled this way."</p>

<p>The trio set off again, the extreme narrowness of the
path compelling them to run in single file. The ground,
hard at first, gradually assumed a moist and muddy
character. Its appearance brought Zabern to a sudden
stop.</p>

<p>"There are no foot-prints here. We are on the wrong
track. Back again. The villains must have flung that
cap into this path purposely to mislead us."</p>

<p>Chafing at their loss of time, they ran back to the place
where the tracks diverged. Other troopers had come up
by this time, and while Paul and Zabern and Nikita took
the middle track others hastened along the right-hand
path.</p>

<p>"They may not have followed the path at all," said
Paul, as he hurried along in the rear of Zabern. "They
may be lying hidden in the wood."</p>

<p>"True; but we'll post through first, and if we find no
trace of them in the road beyond, I'll draw a cordon
round the wood through which they shall not be able to
break."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>"Marshal, did you see the face of him who fired?"
asked Nikita.</p>

<p>"Not clearly."</p>

<p>"Russakoff the spy, or may I turn Muscovite."</p>

<p>"The red-bearded fellow was not tall enough for
Russakoff," answered Paul. "In fact both men struck
me as being remarkably short of stature."</p>

<p>"My eyes have not erred."</p>

<p>"Have it so, then," replied Paul, as he stumbled onward.
"Let us but lay hands upon the villains, and we
shall soon ascertain whether you be right."</p>

<p>A run of a few minutes' duration brought them through
the wood to the highway beyond. A quick glance to the
right threw Zabern into a paroxysm of rage.</p>

<p>Far off on the white dusty road which stretched onward
in a straight line, till it seemed to touch the horizon,
three black objects were visible, each moment dwindling
in size.</p>

<p>"The villains have escaped us," cried Zabern. "They
had horses tethered here with a third man to watch them.
See! here are their hoof-marks in the clay. They'll be
over the frontier within ten minutes. I warrant they are
well provided with Russian passports."</p>

<p>The trio hurried back for horses, but, by the time they
had passed them through the wood, the pursuit had become
a jest.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Night had fallen over Slavowitz.</p>

<p>Excitement was prevailing both within and without the
Diet.</p>

<p>Beneath a glorious starlit sky in the great Zapolyska
Square, which fronted the broad and stately flight of steps
leading up to the entrance of the Sobieskium or Diet-house,
now ablaze with light, was a vast concourse of
people, awaiting the stroke of twelve; for at midnight
the vote was to be taken on the Secular Appropriation Bill&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
measure which had been fiercely debated night after
night during the course of five weeks.</p>

<p>Poles, Muscovites, and Jews formed the bulk of this
throng, but there was a considerable sprinkling of other
elements. Tartars, Cossacks, Hungarians, Roumanians,
Servians&mdash;representatives of all the motley nationalities
of Eastern Europe, elbowed and jostled each other, talking,
singing and cursing in a very Babel of tongues.</p>

<p>Diverse, however, as was the crowd, it fell politically
into two sharp divisions, the one eager for the passing
of the bill, the other eager for its defeat. There was no
neutral party in that square.</p>

<p>So high did the spirit of faction run that Zabern's landau
on its appearance was overturned by a body of malevolent
Muscovites, and the marshal was compelled to
lay about him with his sabre till the military came to his
rescue.</p>

<p>The indignant Poles retaliated a few minutes later by
making an onset upon Lipski, and that deputy escaped
only after a severe mauling.</p>

<p>The game once begun was continued by both factions,
so that it became almost impossible for the succeeding
deputies to reach the Sobieskium, except under police or
military escort, or unless attended by a strong circle of
their own adherents.</p>

<p>Cheers were given by the hostile sections as their respective
favorites were seen safely mounting the steps of
the Diet-house beneath the brilliant light of the suspended
lamps; the singing of the Polish and the Russian Anthems
went on simultaneously all over the square; there
were ugly rushes, displays of fisticuffs, scenes of wild
disorder, that continued to deepen as the night advanced
and the throng increased.</p>

<p>Dorislas, who commanded the mounted cuirassiers
drawn up four deep all round the Sobieskium, was obliged
to accord the crowd considerable license, lest a too frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
interference on the part of the military should lead
to worse mischief.</p>

<p>The tumult and din that filled the Zapolyska Square
penetrated the Sobieskium to the distant chamber where
the Sejm or Diet sat, the Ministerialists or Poles to the
right, the Opposition or Muscovites to the left of the dais,
where was the chair, table, and bell of the President Brunowski,
he who had been one of Paul's opponents in the
<i>salle d'armes</i>.</p>

<p>The presidential bell was in constant requisition on this
particular night, for the debate had taken an extremely
acrimonious turn. The temper of many of the deputies
had not been sweetened by the treatment they had received
at the hands of the populace.</p>

<p>Lipski boldly accused the ministers of hiring ruffians
whose orders were to stop certain members of the Opposition
from reaching the Diet-house and thus to prevent
them from recording their votes.</p>

<p>Zabern, pointing to his own frayed uniform and to the
ugly scratches on his face, replied that though it would be
easy to retort with a "<i>Tu quoque</i>" he would refrain;
that the charge was absurd, for the mob had bestowed
their favors impartially upon both sides of the House.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bora sat in the chamber, for though no
longer of cabinet rank he was still a member of the Diet,
and he gave clear indication of the way in which he intended
to vote by vacating his usual seat and taking a
place next Lipski himself.</p>

<p>Lesko Lipski, deputy for Russograd, editor of the
"Kolokol," an anti-dynastic newspaper, leader of the
Opposition, and author of the Secular Appropriation Bill,
was, as regards appearance, the very antithesis of the
typical Russ. He was slim and beardless, and dressed in
the latest Parisian fashion, though his costume at that moment,
owing to the playfulness of the mob without, was
not quite the same as when it had first left the tailor's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
hands. He had black beady eyes, and his habit of constantly
questioning ministers upon every topic under the
sun seemed to have permanently impressed his face with
an eager, hungry look.</p>

<p>There was in the air of the chamber that nervous feeling
of expectancy which always arises when the issue of a
contest is problematical. On the previous evening every
member of the Diet, Pole and Muscovite alike, had departed
with full conviction that the Appropriation Bill
would pass.</p>

<p>The attempted assassination of the princess had given
a different turn to the matter by creating a feeling of sympathy
for her, a feeling which was likewise extended to
her political views. To secure the triumph of a measure
known to be hateful to the young princess in the first
hours of her joy at escaping the assassin's bullet seemed
an unchivalrous proceeding; and those of the Poles who
had hitherto regarded the bill with favor now began to
reconsider their attitude.</p>

<p>The attempt on the princess's life, deplorable from one
standpoint, was from another decidedly advantageous,
and the ministry were hopeful that they would capture
from the Opposition the minimum six votes necessary to
secure the rejection of Lipski's measure.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour before midnight Zabern rose to wind
up the debate for the ministerial side.</p>

<p>His rising was the signal for a hostile ebullition from
the Muscovite members who dreaded Zabern's oratory.
Not that the marshal was particularly eloquent; far from
it. He had all a soldier's contempt for speech-making
and for the "men of words," as he was wont to term the
Czernovese deputies; a military dictatorship was more
to his liking than a democratic legislature. Hence his
voice was rarely heard in the chamber, but when he did
speak it was always to the point, and his plain, blunt way
of putting matters had often decided wavering voters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
and at that moment there were a good many wavering
voters.</p>

<p>At first Zabern was unable to obtain a hearing. Every
time he attempted to speak, his words were drowned in
a terrible din, occasioned by the clamor of voices, the
stamping of feet, and the banging of desk-lids. Though
the Duke of Bora did not join in yet, as he made no attempt
to check the tumult, Zabern strongly suspected him
of being its secret instigator.</p>

<p>For fully two minutes President Brunowski continued
to swing his bell, but without producing any effect upon
the Opposition, whose intention was plainly to continue
the uproar till midnight, in order to prevent Zabern from
addressing the assembly.</p>

<p>Brunowski whispered a few words in the ear of an
attendant, who left the chamber and returned almost immediately
with a file of gendarmes. In the sudden stillness
that followed upon their entrance, Brunowski sternly
announced his intention of suspending both from the
sitting and from the voting all future disturbers of order,
a threat which effectually silenced the Muscovite clamorers,
who felt that in the present conjuncture they could
not afford to lose a single vote.</p>

<p>The marshal, being free to speak, began by affirming
the obligation imposed upon him of making some comment
upon the recent attempt to assassinate the princess.</p>

<p>At this statement Lipski rose.</p>

<p>"Mr. President, I must protest. The marshal is not in
order. He is evading the subject of the debate, which is
the Secular Appropriation Bill."</p>

<p>"The marshal will doubtless show the relevancy of his
remarks to the matter under discussion," returned Brunowski.
As President of the assembly he tried to be impartial,
but he could not always forget that he was a
Pole.</p>

<p>"The House will understand presently," continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Zabern, "why the honorable deputy wishes the name of
the princess to be kept out of the question. Who is responsible
for this day's outrage? Not the wretched dupe,
who, happily for Czernova, missed his mark. No! as
well blame the bullet, or punish the pistol. Sir," continued
Zabern, addressing the President, "the real authors
of the act are the persons who by their words and writings
have labored to create in Czernova a spirit of hostility to
its legitimate ruler. And of those persons," thundered
the marshal, looking round upon the assembly, "the
deputy for Russograd is the chief."</p>

<p>Lipski was on his feet again in an instant.</p>

<p>"Mr. President, must I sit and hear assassination imputed
to me without raising my voice in protest?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. The marshal must withdraw the
charge, or prove it."</p>

<p>"The proof is forthcoming. The two miserable
wretches who fired at the princess were seen before the
deed seated at the wayside, and strengthening their
wicked determination by reading from a certain newspaper.
I already see the editor of that journal beginning
to look uneasy, for the name of the journal is the
'Kolokol,' and its editor is one Lesko Lipski. The
would-be assassins were diligent students of the 'Kolokol;'
they evidently regarded its editor as a great political
teacher."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" inquired the voice of the duke.</p>

<p>"Well, I judge from this circumstance," answered Zabern,
producing a dirty copy of the 'Kolokol' and unfolding
it. "Here is the identical paper dropped by the
two men in their flight. It contains an article entitled,
'Harmodius the Patriot;' and on the margin of this
article pencil-notes have been scrawled, such as 'Good!'
'True!' 'This seems reasonable,' and the like; nay,
more, we have here in badly spelled Russian this sentiment:
'Death to the girl-tyrant!'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>At this point Zabern held up the journal for the inspection
of the assembly.</p>

<p>"Now I need scarcely remind the House that Harmodius
was a man of ancient days, who assassinated the
ruler of Athens, and was in consequence honored as a
splendid patriot by his fellow-citizens. Why does the
editor of a journal, supposedly devoted to current politics
and affairs of to-day, publish an article on an event that
happened twenty-three centuries ago? Simply because
he wishes to inculcate the doctrine, that, as it was a fine
piece of patriotism to assassinate the ruler of ancient
Athens, so would it be an equally fine piece of patriotism
to assassinate the ruler of modern Czernova."</p>

<p>"I deny the inference that you draw from that article,"
cried Lipski.</p>

<p>"Two at least of your readers understand what you
mean, and have acted upon your hints. Now, on seeing
practical effect given to your teaching, you would cravenly
shirk the responsibility for your part in this outrage.
Be honest; do not run away from your own words.
Perhaps the House will bear with me while I read a few
sentences from this 'Killing No Murder' essay."</p>

<p>"You must read the whole of it, or none," said Brunowski,
"inasmuch as one passage may be modified by
another."</p>

<p>Zabern adopted the President's first alternative, and
read the entire article, which, although written in guarded
language, with a view of preserving its author from the
possibilities of legal indictment, was obviously a plea for
the assassination of rulers who have become obnoxious to
their subjects.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the marshal's reading, there was a
storm of hisses from the Right. The Left sat in sullen
silence.</p>

<p>"It is known to all that on coming to the throne the
princess, with one stroke of her pen, abolished the censorship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
of the press. And this," continued Zabern, pointing
to the criminatory article in the "Kolokol,"&mdash;"this is
how the privilege has been requited! Such, gentlemen of
the Diet, such are the sentiments&mdash;such is the character
of the deputy for Russograd! And yet this teacher of
assassination has the effrontery to come forward and
solicit the votes of the Poles&mdash;the Poles, who, whatever
may be their faults, are at least men of honor, and loyal
to their princess. Vote for this bill? Not if it were
the finest piece of legislation ever devised by the wit of
statesmen. Those who can may separate the man from
his bill; for my part, the two are identical. Every suffrage
cast on the side of Lipski, every vote given in favor
of this bill, is a vote in favor of assassination."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried the Left. "We are not assassins."</p>

<p>"That statement shall be proved by your votes. Let
those who repudiate the work of the assassin, let those
who rejoice at the escape of the princess from death, show
their sympathy by rejecting a bill which is hurtful to the
best feelings of the princess."</p>

<p>And now ensued a dramatic tableau pre-arranged by
the wily Zabern. A small door opened upon the right of
the presidential chair, and Barbara herself entered the hall
of debate, to the utter confounding of the deputies, whose
first thought was that she had come to dissolve the Diet.</p>

<p>Brunowski immediately vacated his chair in favor of
the princess, who took her place on the dais, but remained
standing. Her mien, graceful and bright, offered a pleasing
contrast to that of the angry debaters. Even the Muscovites
were forced to admit that if beauty of person
should entitle one to a crown, their princess would have
carried off all the diadems of Europe.</p>

<p>The silence that came over the chamber caused the din
of voices in the square to be much more plainly heard.
The tumultuous sounds without lent additional excitement
to the scene within.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p>The princess glanced slowly around the assembly, and
then, as if moved by a sudden idea, she removed her hat,&mdash;the
same hat that she had worn on her return from the
review. In the act of taking it off the light from behind
gleamed through a hole in the brim, a mute appeal to the
sympathy of the House, the more striking because
unintentional.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, do not uncover," cried Brunowski.</p>

<p>"I crave your pardon, Mr. President," replied Barbara,
and her utterance sounded like a clear silvery bell
after Brunowski's magnificent bass voice, "but I understand
that the usages of this House require that only one
person shall remain covered."</p>

<p>This was said in reference to Lipski, who, while all the
rest of the deputies were standing uncovered, sat with his
hat on his head.</p>

<p>Zabern, with his sabre clinking against his spurs, strode
across the floor of the House.</p>

<p>"Fellow!" he muttered, grinding his teeth, "if you do
not remove your hat, my troopers shall nail it to your
pate."</p>

<p>And Lipski, seeing Zabern's savage demeanor, prudently
doffed his head-covering.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," said Radzivil, "I move that the
deputy for Russograd be suspended from this sitting for
treating the person of the princess with contempt."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Count," observed Barbara. "Let it not be
said that we sought to deprive a deputy of his vote."</p>

<p>When the ringing of the President's bell had repressed
the cheers evoked by this remark, Barbara proceeded to
explain the reason of her appearance.</p>

<p>"Mr. President, Ministers and Deputies," she began,
speaking with self-possession and dignity, "it may be
said that the princess ought not to intervene in the affairs
of the Diet, but should remain quiescent, and simply register
the decrees of the majority. But, sir," she added,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
with a graceful inclination of her head towards Brunowski,
"your princess is not an automaton, but a human
being with feelings that can be moved. I feel strongly on
this bill, and I do not hesitate to say so."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and then resumed.</p>

<p>"I shall always act with regard to the Constitution. If
this bill should pass I shall affix my signature."</p>

<p>Cheers arose from the Left.</p>

<p>"But I trust the House will not let it pass."</p>

<p>Counter-cheers arose from the Right.</p>

<p>"If my sentiments can in any way influence the decision
of deputies, I would appeal to them, irrespective of
party, to reject this measure."</p>

<p>With this she bowed to the Diet, and withdrew from
the chamber, amid enthusiastic cries of "Long live the
Princess of Czernova!"</p>

<p>The chivalry of the Poles, if not of the Muscovites,
was evoked. The assassin's pistol-shot, the princess's
personal appeal, had produced more effect than all the
oratory of the five previous weeks.</p>

<p>As soon as Brunowski had resumed the presidential
chair, Zabern again spoke.</p>

<p>"The princess has made it a personal question between
herself and Lipski. Well, gentlemen, you have seen the
princess, and&mdash;you see Lipski," he continued, pointing
to that deputy, who looked far from amiable at that moment.
"Can any man doubt," he added, with fine scorn,
"can any man doubt for whom he shall vote? Let it
not be said that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Zabern paused. A sound louder than any they had yet
heard penetrated to the chamber. A mighty roar was
rising from the Zapolyska Square. Twenty thousand
voices blending into one proclaimed that the time had
come for deciding the great controversy. The iron tongue
of the cathedral-clock was booming forth the hour of
midnight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>"The vote will now be taken," cried Brunowski, amid
a scene of indescribable excitement.</p>

<p>"I move that it be taken by secret ballot," exclaimed
Zabern.</p>

<p>"I oppose it," said the Duke of Bora.</p>

<p>The President put the question to the assembly,
and the proposal for secret ballot was carried by
acclamation.</p>

<p>Zabern smiled grimly as he observed the secret glances
of rage interchanged between Bora and Lipski. By this
man&oelig;uvre on his part they were prevented from learning
whether those Poles who had secretly taken the gold of
Orloff would vote according to promise.</p>

<p>In the Diet of Slavowitz, when voting by ballot, each
deputy took from his desk one of a set of discs. These
discs were of two colors, white for affirmation, black for
negation.</p>

<p>Concealing the disc between the fingers and the palm&mdash;carrying
it openly was forbidden on pain of forfeiture of
the vote&mdash;each deputy walked past the presidential table,
and placing his hand within the mouth of a large bronze
urn, dropped the disc.</p>

<p>As a precaution against the artifice of giving more than
one vote, the names of the deputies were marked on the
roll as each person passed by, and the number of counters
checked by this arrangement.</p>

<p>In prescribed order the deputies quitted their seats, and
filed past the table, and for a few moments nothing was
heard but the clink of the metallic discs as they fell within
the urn. Brunowski took no part in the division, but had
the right of a casting-vote.</p>

<p>"One hundred and nineteen members have voted,"
said the chief clerk, looking up from the register, after
the last suffrage had been given.</p>

<p>This was a record division, being the largest that had
ever occurred in the history of the Czernovese Diet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Every deputy, with the exception of Cardinal Ravenna,
was present and had voted.</p>

<p>The great question was how had they voted?</p>

<p>Amid a hush like that in the chamber of the dying when
the fatal moment has come, the chief clerk, at a sign from
the President, slowly inverted the urn, and poured out the
discs upon the red table-cloth.</p>

<p>In their excitement the deputies rose and stood upon
seats and desks, craning their necks forward, eager to
catch the first glimpse of the black and white counters,
eager to learn which of the two was the prevailing color.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>To the waiting populace in the Zapolyska Square the
time taken in recording the votes and in counting the
same seemed unnecessarily long.</p>

<p>A great sensation had been created when the officials of
the House reported to those near the doors that the princess
herself had appeared in the Diet with an appeal for
the rejection of the bill. The story gathered in detail as
it passed from mouth to mouth, and men on the outskirts
of the crowd told how the princess with tears in her eyes
had gone down on her knees before the assembly, and
how Zabern, sabre in hand, had stalked up and down the
chamber threatening to cut the throats of all who would
not vote against the bill.</p>

<p>And when the hour of midnight began to toll, and
Dorislas was seen to fling himself from his charger, and
hurry up the steps of the Diet-house, for the purpose of
recording his vote within the chamber, the interest grew
to fever-heat.</p>

<p>Wild work had been going on in the square, but now
the knowledge that the great division was taking place
had a somewhat quieting effect upon the crowd. All
eyes were turned towards the grand entrance, brilliant
with light that streamed far out into the darkness, for
from this entrance the result was to be proclaimed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<p>Ten minutes after midnight there was a movement at
the head of the stairs; the gendarmes parted, and the
white-haired clerk of the House was seen holding in his
hand the paper inscribed with the momentous result.
Dorislas appeared at the same instant and mounted his
charger in readiness for the riot which he knew to be
imminent.</p>

<p>Standing at the head of the steps the clerk raised his
hand, and at that signal the crowd, which but a moment
before had been surging this way and that, became instantly
immobile. The square was a sea of upturned
faces, each gleaming with painful curiosity. Even the
cuirassiers extended along the front wall of the Diet-house
forgot for a moment their discipline, and bent sideways
in the saddle, eager to hear the result. The stillness
of death prevailed. Not a movement. Not a word. Not
a breath.</p>

<p>"People of Czernova," said the clerk, speaking in a
voice that penetrated to every portion of the square, "in
a House of one hundred and nineteen members, thirty-nine
have voted for the Secular Appropriation Bill, and
eighty against it. The measure therefore stands rejected
by a majority of forty-one."</p>

<p>These figures seemed to show that the voting had been
conducted strictly on party lines. The Muscovite members
of the Diet numbered thirty-eight, or, with the addition
of the Duke of Bora, thirty-nine. The tale of the
Poles was eighty-one; the vote of the absent Ravenna
being deducted, the majority of forty-one was thus accounted
for.</p>

<p>The publication of the figures was followed by a moment
of bewildering silence. The Poles could not believe
in such a victory, nor the Muscovites in such a defeat.
Some among the crowd, supposing that the clerk had made
an error in his statement, called upon him to read it again.</p>

<p>But now at the side of the clerk appeared the tall figure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
of Zabern, waving his helmet and greeting his adherents
with a triumphant smile.</p>

<p>All doubt vanished. Exultant cries of "Slava! slava!"
burst from Polish throats. The Muscovites replied by
yells of execration. The two factions were intermingled;
the triumph of the one evoked the fury of the other, and
in a moment more the Zapolyska Square was transformed
to pandemonium.</p>

<p>"Forward!" cried Dorislas, waving his sabre. "Clear
the square."</p>

<p>And loud above the trampling and the din arose a
carillon of bells from the cathedral of St. Stanislas, pealing
forth a jubilation over the victory gained by the Latin
Church.</p>

<p>Inside the House the excitement was equally great.
Pole shook hands with Pole, for it was felt to be a splendid
party triumph. The Muscovite members stared sullenly
at each other, Lipski himself looking the very incarnation
of malignity. More than a score of Polish
deputies, after accepting splendid bribes, had betrayed
him by voting with Zabern, and he was precluded from
making their duplicity known by the fact that the procuration
of a deputy's vote by bribery was an offence
punishable by perpetual exclusion from the Diet.</p>

<p>Both parties streamed out into the corridors to discuss
the event, leaving Brunowski and a dozen members in the
chamber to pass the resolution: "That the military be
withdrawn from the monasteries."</p>

<p>In a small apartment, adjacent to the hall of debate, sat
Barbara, surrounded by her radiant ministers. An ardent
politician, she was in her element on such nights as these.</p>

<p>"A two-thirds majority of the House!" she murmured
with a glow on her cheek. "Thirty-nine for the bill, and
eighty against it. What a triumph!"</p>

<p>"Thank heaven, our secret is safe!" said Radzivil.
"Kossuth can have his gold."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>"Another defeat for Russia!" grinned Zabern. "How
Orloff will regret the roubles he has wasted!"</p>

<p>In passing along one of the corridors Zabern encountered
the Duke of Bora.</p>

<p>That ex-minister, long a traitor at heart, and a secret
sympathizer with the aims of the Opposition, had at last
cast off the mask, but on a very inopportune occasion as
he now perceived. Hoping to profit by the anticipated defeat
of the ministry, and the consequent confusion, if not
fall, of the princess, he had crossed to the opposite side of
the House, and he had seated himself cheek by jowl with
Lipski and his colleagues, only to see them suffer a most
crushing defeat. His mortification, already great, was
enhanced by Zabern's caustic smile.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear duke, you don't seem quite so cheerful as
you did last week on the Long Terrace. Payment within
one hour after the division," he continued, exhibiting the
duke's written pledge, "was not that our agreement?
May I trouble your grace, then, for the sum of ten thousand
roubles, since our majority has exceeded twenty?
Ten thousand roubles is rather a large amount, but you
will doubtless recoup yourself from Orloff's Bribery
Fund."</p>

<p>If looks had power to kill, Zabern would certainly have
fallen dead beneath Bora's savage glance. Unable, however,
to evade the fulfilment of his word, the duke reluctantly
wrote out a check for the required amount.</p>

<p>"An unforeseen circumstance has enabled you to win
this wager," he said, curtly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a very fortunate&mdash;ah!&mdash;circumstance
for us," drawled Zabern, as he walked away with the
check in his pocket, "but as to its being unforeseen!&mdash;"
He finished the sentence with a short laugh. "Duke of
Bora, you must be the biggest fool in Czernova not to suspect
the game I've played."</p>

<p>Averse to the noisy demonstrations, friendly or hostile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
which her presence in the crowded streets was certain to
evoke, Barbara lingered for some time in the Diet-house,
conversing with the deputies of both parties, and charming
even the rugged hearts of the Muscovites by her
gracious and winsome manner.</p>

<p>When the streets were reported quiet she drove back to
the Vistula Palace, accompanied by Zabern and Paul, the
latter of whom from a side gallery had watched the course
of the debate.</p>

<p>The trio retired to the White Saloon.</p>

<p>"That pistol-shot has wrought us so much good,
marshal," observed Barbara, "that I feel quite capable
of forgiving the assassin."</p>

<p>"Then your Highness shall have an opportunity of
doing so," replied Zabern, "since he, or rather she, is in
the next apartment."</p>

<p>He stamped heavily on the floor thrice. A door opened,
and there entered Katina Ludovska with her sister Juliska,
not now garbed in male attire, as when awaiting
the princess's landau in the forest-road, but dressed each
in her own pretty Polish costume.</p>

<p>They advanced with a somewhat timid air and knelt,
till requested by the wondering princess to rise. They
were not strangers to her, for she had often witnessed
their fencing feats in the <i>salle d'armes</i>.</p>

<p>"This lady," said Zabern, indicating Katina, "craves
pardon for shooting at the princess, without obtaining
her Highness's permission, but at the same time she can
plead that she was acting under the command of Marshal
Zabern."</p>

<p>"Explain," said the princess, haughtily, and with a
flash of her eyes that made even the bold Katina quail.</p>

<p>"It was well known to the Diet," began Zabern, cool
and unabashed, "that your Highness was opposed to the
Appropriation Bill. Six votes only were wanted to secure
its rejection.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, if at the present crisis some desperado would
only oblige us by seeking to kill your Highness, the attempt
would create such a feeling of sympathy among the
secessionist members of our party that not only would
the required six votes be captured, but many more in
addition.</p>

<p>"I therefore resolved that such outrage should take
place. But the deed must have every appearance of reality.
Blank cartridges might suggest a mock attempt, but
real bullets, missing your Highness's person by a hair's-breadth
only, would disarm all suspicion.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, I made overtures to the finest pistol-shot
in Czernova, Katina Ludovska, who consented to
the plan.</p>

<p>"Do not accuse me of recklessly hazarding your Highness's
life, since I was fully convinced that Katina's hand
would not fail, for Juliska of her own accord gave me
striking proof of her sister's unerring marksmanship.
She bade Katina regard her as the princess, and while
Katina stood revolver in hand upon the steps of the inn-door,
Juliska rode fearlessly past on horseback six times
in succession; and on each occasion Katina sent one shot
through the brim of her sister's hat, while the second
whizzed close to her temple.</p>

<p>"This experiment convinced me of Katina's ability to
do the trick, and success has justified my opinion. A bold
liberty on my part, your Highness, but pardonable, considering
the object I had in view."</p>

<p>Barbara's first emotion of breathless amazement was
followed by a sense of anger, as she recalled the dreadful
sensation that came over her when the hot bullet whizzed
past her face.</p>

<p>"Remember," pleaded Zabern, cognizant of Barbara's
feelings, "remember that your Highness gave me <i>carte
blanche</i> to do whatsoever I pleased, provided that I could
but secure the rejection of the Appropriation Bill."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>This was true, but who could have guessed that Zabern
would have resorted to such a desperate remedy?</p>

<p>"And you could devise no other plan than this for
defeating the bill?"</p>

<p>"None, though I racked my brain for a week."</p>

<p>Barbara's anger began to yield to a mournful feeling.
It was her belief that no state can flourish long on duplicity.
If her chief minister could maintain her in power
only by resorting to trickery such as this, then, indeed,
the day of her fall could not be far distant.</p>

<p>"It is past," she murmured. "I am scathless, and the
bill is rejected; what more should I desire?" And then,
addressing Katina and her sister, she said, "You played
a very hazardous game as well with your own lives as
with mine. Why, marshal, you ordered the guards to
fire upon the fugitives!"</p>

<p>"Nikita was in the plot, your Highness, and had taken
the precaution to serve out blank cartridges to your <i>corps
du garde</i>; so the volley was a harmless one. But I confess
my heart was in my mouth when I saw Captain
Woodville taking aim with his pistol. Fortunately he
tripped up in the very act of firing."</p>

<p>"I little thought that I was taking aim at Mistress
Katina," smiled Paul, "and grateful am I that she did
not return the shot. And so Nikita was in the plot?
Why, the rogue vowed that one of the two was Russakoff!"</p>

<p>"He couldn't resist the temptation of poking a little
fun at you," replied Zabern. "Had you looked round, you
would have seen him choking with suppressed laughter."</p>

<p>"And I suppose, marshal, that you led the way down
the path where the red cap lay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Purposely to give Katina and Juliska more time to
escape."</p>

<p>"And I presume, likewise, that it was your hand which
annotated the copy of the 'Kolokol' newspaper?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>"Precisely. Those marginal remarks were my own
invention."</p>

<p>Paul could not refrain from laughter as he recalled the
fine air of indignation with which Zabern had pointed
out to the Diet the annotations that his own pencil had
made.</p>

<p>"Marshal, you lie with admirable grace."</p>

<p>"I have lived five years in Russia, you see."</p>

<p>"But, marshal," remonstrated Barbara, gravely, "you
have placed me in a false position, by letting me pose before
the Diet as the escaped victim of an assassination
plot."</p>

<p>"A splendid way of catching votes," returned Zabern,
coolly. "And votes were what we wanted."</p>

<p>"And you have endeavored to connect Lipski with the
deed. Is that well devised, marshal?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," replied the unscrupulous Zabern. "He
has in his paper advocated the slaying of rulers; he is
therefore a potential, if not an actual, assassin. I have
but given the people of Czernova a practical illustration
of his teaching. O your Highness, let me show that
your consideration for Lipski is somewhat misplaced.
You are doubtless aware that to his editorship of the
'Kolokol' he also adds the calling of gunsmith and
armorer, and a very convenient calling it is for one who
is ill-disposed to the state."</p>

<p>"Be plainer with me, marshal."</p>

<p>"I have long suspected Lipski of treasonable designs,
and therefore, observing a few days ago that a private
house contiguous to his establishment in the Boulevard
de Cracovie was to be let, I instructed one of my spies
to rent and occupy the said house, the cellar of which
adjoins Lipski's. Last night my agent and I cautiously
removed a few bricks from the upper part of the intervening
wall, and turned the light of a lantern through
the orifice thus made. Your Highness, that vault, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
is a lofty and spacious one, contains more rifles than
Lipski will ever be able to sell, even if he should live to
be a centenarian. They lie stacked up from floor to ceiling.
I probably do not overshoot the mark when I say
that there cannot be less than ten thousand. The law
does not permit any citizen, even a gunsmith, to possess
one-twentieth of that number."</p>

<p>"This is a grave matter," said Barbara. "Those arms
must be seized."</p>

<p>"Certainly, your Highness; for while it is right for
us to store up arms against the Czar, it's a monstrous
thing that the Czar's hirelings should be permitted to pile
up arms against ourselves. Never let others do to you
as you would do to them."</p>

<p>"You have a cynical way of putting things, marshal."</p>

<p>"These arms are designed for the denizens of Russograd.
As they are much too poor to purchase their own
rifles, there is to be a free distribution&mdash;probably on the
night of the 14th of September."</p>

<p>"The eve of my coronation," said Barbara, startled by
this announcement.</p>

<p>"The same. My spies report that there are whispers
among the Muscovites of an armed rising to take place
on the coronation day. In fact, they propose to hold a
rival coronation in the Greek basilica. You can guess,
princess, who is to play the central figure in this unauthorized
ceremony."</p>

<p>"A ceremony that shall never take place," said Barbara,
with a flash of her eyes.</p>

<p>"True. We'll foil them. With your sanction, princess,
I'll make no movement at present in this matter.
The longer we delay Lipski's arrest the more the plot
will develop, the wider will be the sweep of our net when
the cast is made, and the more fishes shall we enclose.
Meantime, rest assured that my spy will keep a careful
eye upon that secret store of arms."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>

<p>"Be it so, marshal. We leave the matter to your
wisdom."</p>

<p>"And your Highness pardons that little affair of the
shooting?"</p>

<p>The princess with a smile extended her hand for Zabern
to kiss.</p>

<p>"Without your constant vigilance, marshal, the princess
were nothing."
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XIV<br /><br />
NEARING A CRISIS</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>A few nights after the defeat of the Appropriation
Bill, Paul Woodville at a late hour strolled forth
into the gardens of the Vistula Palace, with no
design of meeting Barbara, but drawn thither chiefly by
the extreme beauty of the moonlight.</p>

<p>He sat down in solitude by the margin of a tree-girt
lake, watching in an abstracted manner the silvery path
of light on its surface, and musing over the strangely
romantic turn his life had taken.</p>

<p>A sudden rustling among the foliage put an end to his
reverie, and on turning he found Barbara by his side.</p>

<p>She was excited, if not angry. There was a defiant expression
upon her face, and a lovely color burned on her
cheek. She was habited as if for a journey, for her
figure was concealed by a cloak with the hood drawn
around her head. Her appearance reminded Paul of
their first meeting in the Illyrian forest; and, as if responsive
to his thoughts, Barbara's first words recalled
that time.</p>

<p>"Paul, do you remember those happy days in Dalmatia?
Come and let us renew them."</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure that I understand."</p>

<p>"Let us leave Czernova this night&mdash;this hour&mdash;now.
Take me with you."</p>

<p>For a moment Paul doubted whether he could have
heard aright. Then recovering from his surprise, he
asked,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>"What has happened to make you take this wild
resolution?"</p>

<p>"There is no other course left us if we are to be united.
Listen!"</p>

<p>She proceeded to explain the cause of her agitation.</p>

<p>It appeared that at a cabinet council held earlier in the
evening Barbara had announced what had for some time
been suspected, namely, that the projected match between
herself and the duke had been dissolved by mutual consent.
Thereupon the Greek Archpastor, Mosco, whom
Barbara suspected of acting as the mouthpiece of the
duke, rose and boldly, yet respectfully, asked the princess
to define her attitude towards her secretary, Captain
Woodville; he invited her to contradict the growing
rumors as to the relationship existing between herself
and the Englishman.</p>

<p>Perceiving that other members of the cabinet were in
sympathy with Mosco's questioning, Barbara put aside
her first impulse, which was haughtily to ignore the
subject, and gave answer that it was her firm resolve
to make Captain Woodville the Prince-consort of
Czernova.</p>

<p>The council were united in maintaining that this could
not be.</p>

<p>"Zabern among the number?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"Zabern spoke not a word&mdash;sure sign that he is on
your side. He deems it prudent to sacrifice his private
opinion to the will of the rest; otherwise Radzivil would
call upon him to resign, and Zabern believes that he can
do me more good in the cabinet than out of it. They have
insisted upon your immediate withdrawal from Czernova.
I pledged my word that you should depart this very
night; but, Paul," she continued, with a laugh that had
something of hysteria in it, "I did not tell them that it
was my intention to accompany you. I will never give
you up, Paul, never. You are dearer to me than crown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
or life. Come, we will go away together, and leave Czernova
to its own devices."</p>

<p>Such was the invitation addressed to Paul by Barbara,
whose arms were encircling his neck as with a garland;
her lovely face was close to his; her dark eyes radiant
with love were looking into his own. Now at last she
seemed to belong to him.</p>

<p>Paul, as previously related, had by the death of a relative
become the possessor of an ample fortune. How
delightful, then, to while away the hours on the sunny
shores of the Riviera with Barbara for his bride! What
admiration her beauty would elicit from all who saw
her! What a halo of romance would surround her personality!
The princess who resigned a throne for love,
who preferred an untitled Englishman to an imperially
connected archduke! He would be the most envied man
in Europe. It was a splendid temptation, but he rose
superior to it.</p>

<p>"If you have pledged your word for my withdrawal,
I must go&mdash;and alone," he added.</p>

<p>"You shall not go to please them," she cried passionately.</p>

<p>"Then I will go to please myself."</p>

<p>"Without me? Do you mean that&mdash;that we must
part forever?"</p>

<p>The anguish of her voice went to Paul's heart. The
stately princess that had confronted the Diet was gone,
and in her place was a clinging, trembling maiden with
eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>"Sweetest Barbara, doubt whatever else you will, but
do not doubt my love. It behoves us to part at least for
a time. I go, but you must remain. Remember, that,
as a princess, you are not your own but your people's.
If you desert Czernova you give to the duke the crown
for which he is basely plotting. Do not let that traitor
succeed. Do not hand over your loyal Poles to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
tyranny of Bora. Abdication on your part will mean the
final triumph of Russia."</p>

<p>"And that triumph is not far distant," replied Barbara
bitterly. "We have received intelligence to-day
from our ambassadors at Berlin and Vienna that Prussia
and Austria have jointly agreed to withdraw from
the responsibility of upholding the integrity of Czernova,
leaving the onus of this political duty to Russia. We
know what this means. In plain language Kaiser and
King will permit the Czar to exercise a free hand in the
principality. The long-threatened annexation is at hand."</p>

<p>"Then it is time for me to be going."</p>

<p>"In my hour of peril?"</p>

<p>"I go to save you from this peril, to deliver you from
the ever-threatening shadow of the Czar. I have a scheme
in mind,&mdash;a scheme so daring that it seems madness to
attempt it; and yet better to dare and fail than not to
dare at all. My plan, if it succeeds, will make Czernova
so strong that it will no longer fear the arms of Russia.
And then," added Paul hopefully, "and then it may be
that in return for such service your ministry will regard
me with more favorable eyes."</p>

<p>Love is proverbially blind, and therefore it will not
seem matter for wonder that the princess in her passionate
attachment to Paul should place more reliance
upon his promise than upon the united wisdom of her
cabinet. But what his plan was she could not learn;
to all her questions he smiled pleasantly and mysteriously;
the sooner he set off the sooner would come its
realization.</p>

<p>But each time he turned to depart Barbara pleaded so
sweetly for delay that he was forced to stay a few minutes
longer; and they continued to sit in the moonlight, Paul
radiant with the hope of coming success, Barbara puzzled,
yet confident in his ability to fulfil his word. They
were a long time in parting, and often after saying what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
they intended as their final farewell they turned again
to repeat it.</p>

<p>Paul at length tore himself away, and had not proceeded
very far when he was met by Marshal Zabern.</p>

<p>"You are leaving Czernova?"</p>

<p>"Since the cabinet decrees it."</p>

<p>"But you must return."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"On the eve of the princess's coronation."</p>

<p>"Why on that day?"</p>

<p>Zabern bent his head and whispered. The communication
was such as to cause Paul's eyes to sparkle and his
hand to seek the hilt of his sabre.</p>

<p>"Is that the plan of the duke, then?"</p>

<p>"Such is my belief. And you alone, Captain Woodville,
can defeat it. You will be there?"</p>

<p>"Can you doubt it? If I be living."</p>

<p>"Good! You will have the laugh of these fools,"
returned Zabern, referring to his colleagues in the ministry.
"They will not deny you the hand of the princess
then."</p>

<p>And Paul and Zabern parted on an understanding eminently
satisfactory to both.</p>

<p>On the following day the ministry learned with relief
that Captain Woodville had quitted Czernova, though
none knew, not even Barbara, whither he had betaken
himself.</p>

<p>The coronation ceremony was now but two months
distant, and Zabern ventured to remind the princess that
some of its most important details still awaited settlement.</p>

<p>"The great question is who shall have the high honor
of crowning your Highness?"</p>

<p>"Abbot Faustus, for he is a good man," replied Barbara;
and, noting Zabern's look of surprise, she added,
"He, and none other. The cabinet have had their way
in the matter of Captain Woodville; I will have my way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
in this. Let the council meet again to-day. When this
point comes to be discussed, do you, marshal, propose
Abbot Faustus for the office, and I will assent."</p>

<p>Though wondering much at her choice, Zabern refrained
from comment.</p>

<p>That same evening another cabinet council was held
in the Vistula Palace, Barbara again presiding.</p>

<p>Among the members present was the Archbishop
Mosco, or, as he was styled in Slavowitz, the Archpastor,
who, as previously stated, had a seat in the cabinet,
not by the appointment of the princess, but by
virtue of his office as head of the Greek Church in
Czernova.</p>

<p>The crowning of the sovereign had hitherto been one
of the privileges attaching to his see. Barbara's Latin
faith, however, had necessarily deprived him of his prerogative,
which would thus seem to devolve by natural
right upon the highest ecclesiastic in the Catholic Church
of Czernova, or in other words, upon the Cardinal Archbishop
Ravenna.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Zabern rose to propose that Abbot
Faustus, of the Convent of the Transfiguration, should
have the high honor of crowning the princess, there
were murmurs of dissent from the council, the majority
not deeming the abbot of sufficient dignity for
the office.</p>

<p>"The cardinal would regard such appointment as an
affront to himself," remarked Radzivil.</p>

<p>"And might seek, in his disappointment, to give us
trouble," commented Dorislas. "Being the ecclesiastical
superior of Faustus, he might appear in the cathedral and
interdict the abbot from crowning the princess, which
would be a pretty scandal."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," replied Zabern, carelessly, "we have
prisons for disorderly prelates, as well as for law-breaking
dukes."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p>"What says her Highness in this matter?" said Radzivil
turning to the princess.</p>

<p>"The marshal's nomination meets with my approval,"
returned Barbara. "My lords, I will not now enter into
my reasons. Let it suffice to say that Cardinal Ravenna
has made it impossible for me to receive the crown from
his hands. Sooner would I resign than do so."</p>

<p>Great wonderment appeared on the faces of the ministers,
yet none ventured to ask in what way the cardinal
had offended. Opposition to the abbot was immediately
withdrawn, for the cabinet, gratified by Barbara's supposed
dismissal of Paul, were in a complaisant mood,
though they plainly saw trouble looming ahead in thus
excluding Ravenna from participating in the coronation.</p>

<p>At this point of the debate Polonaski intervened with a
suggestion. He was the Justiciary, and by virtue of his
office the highest legal authority in Czernova.</p>

<p>"Since your Highness reigns over Greeks as well as
Catholics, would it not be politic to conciliate the former
by permitting a Greek prelate to have some share, however
small, in your coronation?"</p>

<p>"That is good counsel," replied Barbara. "I trust,
my lord," she added, addressing Mosco with a gracious
smile, "that you have not viewed with bitterness this
setting aside of the ancient privilege attaching to your
see? But, indeed, you are welcome to take whatever part
you please in my coronation, short of the administration
of the Sacrament and of the imposition of the diadem."</p>

<p>Mosco, apparently gratified by this concession, spent
a few moments in studying the coronation ritual, a copy
of which had been supplied to each member of the
cabinet.</p>

<p>"I ask for nothing more," he finally observed, "than
for leave to read the Gospel at the beginning of the
ceremony."</p>

<p>"It is granted," replied Barbara, wondering why the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
archpastor should select this, a somewhat humble office,
compared with others which were open to him.</p>

<p>Mosco's lips curved into a smile, which, though lasting
but a moment, did not escape the quick eye of Zabern,
who immediately became full of suspicion.</p>

<p>"As I live," he muttered to himself, "our archpastor
is a traitor! Have I got rid of Bora only to find that he
has left a successor in the cabinet? That smile means
mischief. But what mischief can come from the reading
of the Gospel?"</p>

<p>An enigma which was not solved till the actual day of
the coronation, and those who witnessed the solution
were not likely ever to forget it.</p>

<p>That picturesque personage, accustomed to figure at a
coronation, namely, the champion, now became a subject
of discussion, Mosco himself having introduced the
question.</p>

<p>"It is the duty of such champion," he explained in answer
to Barbara's interrogation, "to stand before the
throne, and, casting down a glove, to defy to mortal combat
any one who shall openly challenge the right of the
sovereign to rule."</p>

<p>"But why," said the princess, with a pitying smile,
"why should we retain a feudal usage out of place in this
nineteenth century?"</p>

<p>"It has always formed a part of the coronation ceremonial,"
protested Mosco. "Your late father, Prince
Thaddeus, would not have it omitted when he was
crowned."</p>

<p>"And what would happen," asked Radzivil, "if some
one malevolently disposed towards the princess should
step forward and pick up the glove?"</p>

<p>"We had better consult the Justiciary," smiled Barbara.
"He is our authority on all matters of law."</p>

<p>"Your Highness," returned Polonaski, "the ancient
statute touching the championing of the sovereign's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
rights has never been repealed, and therefore still stands
good in point of law. Should any one accept the champion's
challenge by taking up the gage thrown down,
the combat would have to take place."</p>

<p>"With what result?" queried Radzivil. "Will you
say that if her champion should fall the princess must
resign the throne?"</p>

<p>"According to the law of Czernova," replied the
Justiciary.</p>

<p>Zabern leaned back in his seat and caustically whispered
in the premier's ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Count, methinks you were a little premature last
night in banishing an excellent swordsman from Czernova."</p>

<p>"I venture to differ from the Justiciary," remarked the
princess. "An earlier law is always repealed by a later.
Therefore the feudal statute which has been cited is abrogated
by the recent Anti-duelling Act. We will therefore
omit this pretended championing of our rights as an
obsolete, barbarous, and unmeaning ceremony."</p>

<p>The Justiciary did not look as if convinced by Barbara's
reasoning. He refrained from further comment,
however, and the motion to omit the champion from the
ceremonial was unanimously accepted.</p>

<p>Various other matters relative to the solemnity were
settled, after which the council broke up, leaving Zabern
still troubled by Mosco's smile. A permanent member of
the cabinet, the Greek archpastor, equally with the Roman
archbishop, could not be removed at will by the princess
or the premier, unless guilty of treason, and of this Zabern
as yet lacked proof.</p>

<p>"He is playing Bora's game," muttered the marshal.
"He is a party to Lipski's plot. I warrant he knows
all about the store of arms concealed in that traitor's
cellar. Mosco, you shall sit no more as the betrayer of
our meetings, for none shall be held. For some time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
come Czernova shall be governed by a council of three&mdash;the
princess, Radzivil, and myself."</p>

<p>But the evil which the Greek archpastor might do was
as nothing compared with what the Roman archbishop
could effect, and in the course of a few days Barbara
found herself facing a peril of which even her confidant
Zabern little dreamed.</p>

<p>A week after Paul's departure Cardinal Ravenna returned
to Slavowitz, coming from Rome in no good
humor. The Sacred College, at the invitation of the
Pope, had been spending many days in the discussion of
some abstruse doctrine of theology, much to the irritation
of Ravenna, whose self-interest required his presence
in Czernova.</p>

<p>In the first hour of his return he was made aware that
the cabinet, ignoring his superior claims, had deputed
Abbot Faustus to crown the princess, and that all men
were talking of the event; for inasmuch as it was the
current belief that Ravenna was the very person who had
converted the princess to the Catholic faith, the Czernovese
were naturally not a little mystified by this exclusion
of the archbishop from the coronation ceremony.</p>

<p>Ravenna knew full well that this appointment could
not have been made without the sanction of Barbara herself,
and accordingly on the following morning he repaired
to the Vistula Palace, his mortification becoming
still further enhanced by the mocking smile of his Greek
rival, whom he chanced to pass on the way. Barbara
received the cardinal with a chilling mien.</p>

<p>"Is it true, princess," he began with a grave air, "that
in the matter of the coronation you have given to the
Abbot Faustus, my inferior, the honor which belongs of
right to the archbishop?"</p>

<p>"Quite true," responded Barbara, coldly.</p>

<p>"Do you intend, then, with set purpose, to put an
affront upon me in the sight of all Czernova?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>

<p>"None but pure hands shall set the diadem upon my
head. Shall I accept the Sacrament from one who has
insulted me with words of unhallowed love, repeat prayers
uttered by your lips? My lord cardinal," she added in
scorn, "have you no conscience?"</p>

<p>Probably not. He was indifferent to the moral precepts
of religion, if not at heart wholly atheistic, having adopted
the ecclesiastic life merely as a stepping-stone to power.</p>

<p>"Is it likewise true that Zabern purposes at no distant
date to introduce into the Diet a bill for the expulsion of
Jesuits from Czernova?"</p>

<p>"Your eminence has been correctly informed. We
cannot tolerate in the principality those whose aim it is
to create an <i>imperium in imperio</i>. Besides," added the
princess, caustically, "a Jesuit Expulsion Bill will put
my Muscovite subjects in a good humor, while not
greatly offending the Catholics."</p>

<p>Though maintaining a calm exterior, the cardinal
nevertheless listened with secret dismay, for her words
were the very death-knell of his ambition. By using the
princess as his instrument he had hoped to play the <i>rôle</i>
of a Richelieu in Czernova, and to be the supreme director
of affairs, secular as well as ecclesiastical. By
reason of his supposed conversion of a Greek princess
he had obtained a high place in the Pope's favor. He had
openly boasted at the Vatican that the Greek heresy would
soon vanish from Czernova. But now? The attitude of
Barbara and her cabinet showed that he had been building
castles in the air.</p>

<p>Was this to be the end of his life's work? Must he
write "failure" across the scheme that had occupied his
mind for twenty years? It would seem so.</p>

<p>"Is it to be war between us? Good! Thus, then, do
I take up the gage flung down by you. On your coronation
day, in the sight of all assembled in the cathedral,
I shall rise to affirm, ay, and to prove too, that you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
not Natalie Lilieska. I shall denounce you as an impostor,
as a knowing usurper of the rights of Bora."</p>

<p>"And be arrested as an accomplice of the impostor;
since, if I fall, you fall with me."</p>

<p>"Not so, princess; for I shall previously have made
my terms with Bora. You may count, now, upon having
the Pope as your enemy, since you are bent upon
persecuting the Society of Jesus. By falsely claiming to
be princess you have imposed upon the Holy Father.
You admit a heretical prelate to participate in the ceremony
of your coronation. You pretend to be a Catholic,
yet your ministers have placarded Slavowitz to the effect
that the princess will swear at the altar to preserve inviolate
the ancient privileges as well of the Greek as of
the Latin Church. Such Laodicean policy will not suit
Pio Nono. A word in his ear from me will bring against
you a bull of excommunication. And, remember, that
the subjects of an excommunicated ruler are absolved
from their allegiance."</p>

<p>Barbara laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"We are not living in the time of the Crusades. Excommunication
is an obsolete weapon."</p>

<p>"Not so obsolete as you deem, princess. The Poles
are loyal, or shall we say superstitious, Catholics. Many
of them will obey the Pope rather than yourself. There
will be a cleavage in the ranks of your Polish adherents
fatal to your interests. Barbara Lilieska, with the Pope
and the Catholic clergy of Czernova alienated from you;
with dissension among your own adherents; with the
duke and his Muscovite faction opposed to you; with
the jealous Czar, ready, nay, eager, to march his armies
against the usurping princess who had so often thwarted
his policy&mdash;it will pass the wit of Zabern himself to keep
you upon the throne. Dream not of your coronation.
You may ride in state to the cathedral, but only to witness
the crowning of Bora. From that ceremony you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
will return not to this Vistula Palace, but to that Citadel
in which you once imprisoned the duke. He hates you
bitterly since your rejection of him for Captain Woodville.
Now he will be able to wreak his vengeance upon
you. You will have to drink deep of the cup of humiliation.
Are you prepared for this?"</p>

<p>Barbara sat, pondering over the difficulties of her position.
Then amid her troubled thoughts came the memory
of Paul and of his mysterious plan, and she took courage.</p>

<p>The cardinal stood silently drinking in the beauty of
her face and figure, loving and hating her in the same
moment, hoping against hope that she would change her
attitude towards him.</p>

<p>So long did Barbara remain mute that the cardinal
began to think that her opposition was weakening, and
under this delusion he ventured to renew his proposals
of love.</p>

<p>"No more such language, my lord," said the princess,
her eyes flashing with indignation, "or I call the
guard."</p>

<p>"And thereby precipitate your immediate ruin. The
news of my imprisonment would cause my nephew Redwitz
of Zamoska to put in evidence the three sealed letters.
At present the secrets contained within them are
unknown even to him; but in a day more all the world
would be talking of the impostor-princess of Czernova.
There are still seven weeks left to you; why abbreviate
your reign?"</p>

<p>Ravenna had spoken without his accustomed caution
in revealing the names Redwitz and Zamoska, which last
was a small town in Russia, distant a few miles from the
Czernovese border. Though trembling with anger at
the cardinal's insolence, which a hard necessity compelled
her to tolerate, Barbara did not let the phrase
"Redwitz of Zamoska" escape her. The words seemed
to afford a ray of hope. If these letters could be seized,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
and the cardinal arrested on one and the same day, why&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Barbara Tressilian," said the cardinal quietly, "your
aversion to illicit love would seem to combat the theory
of heredity."</p>

<p>At this singular utterance the princess gave a palpable
start.</p>

<p>"The daughter is more scrupulous than the mother."</p>

<p>These words and the cold sneer accompanying them
occasioned in Barbara a fear far greater than that caused
by the threat of deposition.</p>

<p>"What devil's lie are you inventing now?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Your English mother, Hilda Tressilian, was content
to be wooed and won without asking the church to consecrate
her love."</p>

<p>If it be possible for the human heart to suspend its
pulsation, then Barbara's heart did at that moment.</p>

<p>When at last she spoke it was in a voice breathless
with indignation. "Can there be a more base deed
than to slander a dead mother in the presence of her
daughter?"</p>

<p>"No slander, but the solemn truth do I speak. Your
father, Prince Thaddeus, withheld this knowledge from
you, from a desire to spare your feelings. When after
the Dalmatian earthquake of two years ago, you were
wavering between the crown of a princess and the veil
of a nun, the knowledge that you were of illegitimate
birth might have deterred you from accepting the crown;
therefore Prince Thaddeus kept that matter a secret.
He invented the story that the church, the scene of his
marriage, had been burnt, and the record of the union
destroyed; and the more effectually to deceive you he
made choice in his fiction of a certain church which had
actually been consumed by fire. But the preservation of
the edifice would have availed you nothing, for its marriage-book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
contained no such names as Thaddeus Lilieski
and Hilda Tressilian."</p>

<p>"It is a question betwixt my father's word and yours.
I prefer my father's."</p>

<p>"Naturally, inasmuch as it suits your interests.
When on your crowning-day, and before a vast assembly,
I rise to deny that you are Natalie Lilieski, will
you dare affirm it, knowing, as you do, that you lack a
certain birth-mark of that princess? If you aver that
you are in reality Barbara Lilieska, the elder daughter of
Thaddeus, what answer will you give to those who challenge
you to produce the proofs of Thaddeus's early marriage?
Barbara Tressilian, you are illegitimate, and
as such debarred from reigning. Your beauty has made
you many enemies among the proud and envious ladies
of Czernova. Those over whom you have queened it will
be able to point the finger of scorn at the discrowned
princess, branded with the stain of illicit birth."</p>

<p>He marked with secret pleasure the shiver of wounded
pride on the part of Barbara, and clenched his remarks
with the question,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Knowing what I can effect, do you still maintain your
defiance of me?"</p>

<p>"I do," responded Barbara, quietly. "Believing myself
to be the lawful princess of Czernova, I shall hold
to my throne. Girt around with earthly perils, I tranquillize
my mind by looking above, confiding in the justice
of heaven."</p>

<p>That any one should think of trusting to such a
shadowy weapon as the justice of heaven drew a sneer
from the atheistic cardinal.</p>

<p>"The history of Poland should have taught you that
God is always on the side of the strong." And then,
conscious of the futility of further argument, he made a
mock bow, and with the words, "Farewell, Princess
Lackland," he withdrew from the saloon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara retired to her own private apartments, and was
seen no more that day, save by her personal attendants.</p>

<p>Her belief in her legitimacy had rested upon her
father's word; but how if he had deceived her? The
thought that she might be of illicit birth rankled in her
mind, poisoning all her happiness. She clenched her
hands in agony, and unable to sit still, paced restlessly
to and fro.</p>

<p>The spirit of justice was deep-planted within Barbara's
breast; a throne unlawfully held had no attractions for
her; if she could be certain that the cardinal's statement
were true, then, bitter though the duty might be, she must
resign the crown of Czernova to her enemy Bora. But
she was not certain, and therein lay the torture. She
would have no peace of mind till the question should be
settled, and unfortunately the circumstances of the case
seemed to preclude the possibility of solving the doubt.</p>

<p>When Zabern next day sought the presence of the
princess, he was struck by her pallid complexion and
melancholy air.</p>

<p>"The cabinet," he muttered to himself, mistaking the
cause of her sadness, "will have to recall Woodville, or
our princess's health will give way. Your Highness,"
he said aloud, "Dorislas has just proposed a conundrum."</p>

<p>"To what effect?" asked Barbara with a smile.</p>

<p>"'Whether does Cardinal Ravenna live at Slavowitz
or at Rome?' I confess I am unable to answer it. It
is but forty-eight hours since the cardinal's return, and
yet we now hear that he has set off again for Rome, and
will not come back till your coronation eve."</p>

<p>"When he will bring with him," observed Barbara,
quietly, "a papal bull excommunicating the Princess of
Czernova."</p>

<p>"Ha! he'll be well advised not to read it," said Zabern,
touching the hilt of his sabre significantly. "I plainly
foresaw that our preference for Faustus would make an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
enemy of Ravenna. And so he hath gone to Rome to
solicit a bull of excommunication? And he'll obtain it.
Our intended attack on the Jesuits will not please Pio
Nono; once their foe, he hath of late become their friend
and patron. Excommunication! Thus does the Church
reward us for preserving her property, since in fighting
for our own Convent of the Transfiguration, we were
fighting likewise for all the other monasteries of Czernova;
for which service it now appears we are to receive
papal curses. Humph! 'Catholicism without the Pope'
will soon have to be our cry."</p>

<p>"Marshal," said Barbara, resolving to make Zabern a
confidant of her secret history, "did you not present me
with a handsome bow and quiver about six months ago?"</p>

<p>Zabern replied in the affirmative, wondering why the
princess should have introduced a matter seemingly
irrelevant.</p>

<p>"Have you not felt hurt that I have never once made
use of your gifts?"</p>

<p>"The princess has been occupied with more important
matters."</p>

<p>"Shall I give you my reason?"</p>

<p>"If your Highness wills."</p>

<p>"The reason is very simple. I have never handled
bow and arrow, and it might create suspicion if I should
now begin to learn."</p>

<p>"Now your Highness is jesting," said Zabern, puzzled
to account for this humor on the part of the princess, because
Barbara was not in the habit of jesting; and, moreover,
if her remark were intended for a jest, it was
somewhat difficult to see the point. "You shoot like
Diana herself, or rather, I should say you did, for I must
confess that since your Dalmatian tour you seem to have
taken a dislike to archery."</p>

<p>"Marshal, I have never in my life taken aim at a
target."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p>Zabern was completely dumfounded by the seriousness
with which Barbara spoke. On recovering from his
surprise, he said, smiling the while, for he did not believe
in what he was saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then if I am to accept your Highness's statement
as true, it must follow as a logical conclusion that
the young princess who handled the bow so admirably
three years ago is not the same as she who now
addresses me."</p>

<p>"Now you have hit upon my secret, marshal. I am
not Natalie Lilieska."</p>

<p>"And I am not Ladislas Zabern," laughed the other.
He could not tell why the princess spoke thus; he certainly
could not believe her.</p>

<p>"Now, Zabern, be serious, for I am serious. Can you
not recall when I first came here from Dalmatia, many
supposed lapses of memory on my part? Was it not a
common saying at that time, 'The princess has grown
very forgetful?' Was I ever seen without either my
father or Ravenna by my side? The truth is they were
secretly instructing me as to the persons whom I met,
giving me their names, history, and the like. And yet in
spite of many blunders on my part, no one seemed to have
any suspicion as to the truth, not even the Duke of Bora.
Listen," continued Barbara to the utterly bewildered
marshal, "listen while I give you a secret chapter of my
biography."</p>

<p>Zabern gave due heed; and though the story was one
of the most marvellous and most romantic that had ever
come under his notice, either in history or fiction, he was
compelled to believe in its truth, for what motive could
the princess have in fabricating such story?</p>

<p>But when he was made aware of the sacrifice which
the cardinal had demanded of Barbara as the price of his
silence, Zabern became first cold with horror, then hot
with rage. A saint as regarded his own dealings with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
women, he viewed with peculiar aversion a priest addicted
to illicit amours.</p>

<p>"By heaven, your Highness, if I had but known this
three hours earlier I would have cut the villain's throat."</p>

<p>"And thereby, in the cardinal's words, have precipitated
my immediate ruin. We must act warily. Listen."</p>

<p>And here Barbara proceeded to enlighten the marshal
as to Redwitz of Zamoska, the guardian of the three
sealed letters; and how on receiving intelligence of his
uncle's imprisonment or death, the nephew was to despatch
these missives,&mdash;one to the Russian Foreign Minister,
a second to the Duke of Bora, and a third to the
office of the "Kolokol" newspaper.</p>

<p>"A subtle knave!" smiled Zabern.</p>

<p>Himself born with a genius for plotting, the marshal
took a keen zest in outwitting the plans of others, and in
his view the cardinal's contrivance for safeguarding himself
presented some interesting features.</p>

<p>"I fail to see why your Highness should fear the cardinal.
You are so like Princess Natalie in face and figure
that you can laugh at his threat to expose you on the
coronation day. We will ascribe his statement to the
malice of a disappointed ecclesiastic."</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Barbara, with a shake of her graceful
head. "My sister Natalie had a mole upon her right
shoulder, as the physicians who attended her birth, and
the nurses and ladies who waited upon her, can prove.
I have no such mark. Now, Zabern, never lacking in
subtle counsel, you see my peril. Aid me. You defeated
Lipski; now defeat the cardinal for me."</p>

<p>"A very easy matter. Why did not your Highness
confide in me before?"</p>

<p>"How&mdash;easy? In what way do you propose to act?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, are you certain that no one knows
your secret besides ourselves, Ravenna, and Captain
Woodville? This Redwitz, for example?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>"The cardinal asserted that his nephew was ignorant
of the contents of the three packets."</p>

<p>"Good! For my own part I do not think it probable
that the cardinal would share so valuable a secret with
others; his own self-interest would forbid it. Well,
now," mused Zabern, "if we lay violent hands upon
Ravenna the nephew over the border will send off the
letters."</p>

<p>"That has been my fear."</p>

<p>"On the other hand, if I despatch an agent to the
house of Redwitz to obtain possession of the letters, and
it would be very easy to effect this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then Redwitz, discovering his loss, would notify the
fact to the cardinal, who would thus become apprised of
our design."</p>

<p>"True, princess; therefore our plan is obvious. Either
the seizure of the papers and the seizure of the cardinal
must take place coincidently, or&mdash;But leave it to me,
your Highness," added Zabern, breaking off somewhat
abruptly. "Let the cardinal enjoy his brief span of life
at Rome. As soon as he returns he shall be secretly seized
in his own palace, instantly gagged to prevent him from
revealing anything even to his captors, and conveyed in
a covered carriage to the oubliettes of the Citadel. He
shall never see daylight again."</p>

<p>Much as the cardinal might deserve such fate, Barbara
nevertheless could not repress a shudder.</p>

<p>"Marshal," she said, with a grave look, "it is a dangerous
thing to seize, imprison, and execute a cardinal,
a prince of the Church, without any pretence at a trial.
The Pope&mdash;all Europe&mdash;will have something to say on
the matter."</p>

<p>"Trial? We dare not try him, for then would he make
known to the judges and others the very matter we wish
to keep secret. Ours is a dangerous game, true; but it
would be far more dangerous to let the villain live. Still,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
there is no need for his arrest; there are other and safer
ways. The cardinal may disappear mysteriously, and
then Marshal Zabern, the Minister of Justice, will offer
a large reward, ay, and will give it, too, to any one who
can tell what has become of the missing archbishop. Or,"
added Zabern, grimly, "he may be found to have committed
suicide in his own palace."</p>

<p>Zabern spoke without the least scruple. He was not
naturally cruel nor treacherous, but he reflected that the
crown of Czernova was at stake, and with it, so he believed,
the future liberation of Poland; and where these
weighty matters were concerned, the secret removal of a
cardinal was but a light thing in his eyes.</p>

<p>But Barbara was distressed. Must she resort to crime,
she who had declared to the cardinal that her reliance was
upon heaven? For her conscience refused to palliate Zabern's
intended deed; the slaying of Ravenna without trial
would be murder, and murder wrought to secure a title the
validity of which she herself was beginning to question.</p>

<p>Zabern noted her look of pain.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, bestow no pity upon the cardinal;
he deserves death, if ever man deserved it. Consider the
case of your sister Natalie. Do not believe that she committed
suicide. A maiden of seventeen, to whom life was
just unfolding fair and bright, heiress to a crown, and
affianced to a man whom she loved&mdash;heaven forgive her
for her choice!&mdash;she had every inducement to live.
Doubt not that the cardinal had a hand in her death.
Give me leave to employ the rack upon him, and I'll
soon extract the truth."</p>

<p>"You have my authority for his arrest and conveyance
to the oubliettes of the Citadel. Solitary confinement
and a deaf jailer, if you will; but murder&mdash;no!
<i>Fiat voluntas mea.</i>"</p>

<p>With that the interview terminated, and Zabern departed
to reduce to practice the plan he had formed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>Four weeks afterwards he presented to the princess
three small packets, each fastened with violet-colored
wax, stamped with the image of a paschal lamb, a seal
that recalled vividly to her mind the mysterious incidents
connected with the cardinal's study at Castel Nuovo.</p>

<p>"There are Ravenna's documentary safeguards,"
laughed Zabern. "One half of our task is accomplished."</p>

<p>"How have you managed it?" asked Barbara.</p>

<p>"Katina's sister Juliska has been my agent. Going to
Zamoska she succeeded in making acquaintance with a
maid-servant belonging to the household of this Redwitz,
who, it appears, is a Catholic priest. By the offer of a
large bribe Juliska persuaded this girl to ask her master's
leave to visit a dying brother in a distant part of Russia,
the said dying brother being, of course, a mythical personage;
in the meantime, the maid averred, her duties
could be performed by a friend of hers then resident in
Zamoska. The unsuspecting Redwitz gave his consent,
and the pretty Juliska took up her residence under the
priest's roof in the character of temporary servant.</p>

<p>"Fortunately for our plan one of her duties was to attend
to the study of this Redwitz, and, making careful
search in his absence, she soon lighted upon these three
packets in a secret drawer of an escritoire. Having been
provided beforehand with the necessary materials,
namely, violet wax and the cardinal's seal, Juliska quickly
made up three blank packets outwardly similar in all respects
to the originals; and the latter being abstracted
from the escritoire were replaced by the fac-similes."</p>

<p>Barbara, breaking the seals, proceeded to read the contents
of the three missives, which were all couched in
much the same terms. Each began by affirming that the
then regnant Princess of Czernova was not Natalie Lilieska,
and various circumstances were adduced in proof
of this statement. The document then went on to assert,
and the assertion brought the color of shame to Barbara's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
cheek, that the self-styled Natalie was the illegitimate
daughter of the late Prince Thaddeus, and therefore
legally debarred from reigning.</p>

<p>"Mother of God! can this be true?" murmured Barbara,
with anguish at her heart.</p>

<p>The cardinal did not deny his own share in the plot by
which Barbara had been raised to the throne, but rather
took credit to himself in a matter, which, as he fondly
hoped, would tend to advance the interests of the Catholic
Church in Czernova. He concluded by stating that he
lived in some fear of the princess, who viewed him with
dislike, as being the sole depositary of her secret; therefore
if he should be arrested, or should be secretly slain,
or should mysteriously disappear, men would know to
whom the deed should be ascribed.</p>

<p>Barbara, having read the documents, threw them upon
the fire, and watched till they were consumed.</p>

<p>"Nothing now remains," remarked Zabern, "but to
arrest the cardinal in the first moment of his return."</p>

<p>"There is another who threatens my safety. When,
marshal, do you intend to seize Lipski, and his store of
arms?"</p>

<p>"Not till the day before the coronation, so please your
Highness."</p>

<p>"Where is the advantage in this delay?"</p>

<p>"Why, thus. If we arrest Lipski now we give the
enemy opportunities of forming new plans, and of collecting
fresh supplies of weapons, whereas a raid on the
very eve of the coronation will throw the plotters into a
confusion, from which they will not have time to recover."</p>

<p>"But if the arms should be carried forth before the
14th of September?"</p>

<p>"My spies are on the watch; of course if that should
occur, I shall have to antedate my raid. Has Radzivil
informed your Highness that the Czar is sending his representative
to attend your coronation?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>"The same ambassador as before, the insolent-tongued
Orloff, he who so strangely presumed to doubt the existence
of our Charter? Let the court marshal appoint him
a seat near the high altar, whence he can view our document
at his leisure, nay, handle it, if he will," she added.</p>

<p>"The Charter!" muttered Zabern, grimly, as he withdrew
from the presence of Barbara. "The Charter,
humph; I'll not add to your present anxieties, princess,
by stating the truth. Will that devil of an Orloff suspect
my man&oelig;uvre?"</p>

<p>As the day assigned for the coronation drew near, the
ancient and stately capital of Czernova began to assume a
gala aspect. Flags waved in every street. Bright drapery
wrought with mottoes decked the walls. Venetian masts
and triumphal arches arose. In a word, all things deemed
essential to a great state-pageant were in due course of
preparation.</p>

<p>For the maintenance of order troops were drafted daily
into Slavowitz, until one half at least of the Czernovese
army was quartered in various parts of the capital.</p>

<p>The Muscovite populace, disposed at first to be wrathful
at the holding of the coronation in a Catholic edifice,
moderated their ire somewhat on learning that their own
Archpastor Mosco was to take part in the solemnity,
while the great cardinal, the object of their hatred, was to
be entirely excluded.</p>

<p>Placards containing the words of the amended coronation
oath were posted up in public places, that all might
see that the princess would pledge herself at the altar to
respect the rights both of the Greek and of the Latin
churches.</p>

<p>The disaffected, who were hoping for riots on the
coronation day, seemed fated to meet with disappointment,
owing to the judicious and pacificatory policy of
the princess's ministry.</p>

<p>That ministry took courage, and anticipated, nay, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
confident, that the great day would pass off without
disturbance.</p>

<p>Then came a bolt from the blue!</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the day prior to the coronation,
Radzivil and Zabern sought the presence of the
princess.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," said the premier, "a Russian army
of one hundred thousand men is assembling at Zamoska."</p>

<p>Zamoska, distant but six miles from the frontiers of
Czernova!</p>

<p>"A Russian army at Zamoska?" repeated Barbara.</p>

<p>"And commanded by the Czar in person," added
Radzivil.</p>

<p>"What is the Czar's object in mustering his troops so
near our own borders?"</p>

<p>"When the news reached us late last night," said the
premier, "your ladies reported that you were in so sweet
a sleep that it would be wrong to disturb you. I therefore
took upon myself to send an envoy in your name to the
Czar to inquire the reason for this massing of troops so
close to our frontiers."</p>

<p>"You did quite right, my lord. Has the messenger
returned?"</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago. And the explanation given is
that the Russian army is gathering at Zamoska for the
autumn man&oelig;uvres."</p>

<p>"You do not believe this story?" said the princess,
turning to Zabern.</p>

<p>"Princess, no. You must nerve yourself to bear the
truth. In my opinion the Czar is assembling his forces for
the purpose of preventing your Highness's coronation."</p>

<p>"By what right?" exclaimed Barbara, with flashing
eyes, and Zabern was glad to see that she who had most
reason for fear showed far more spirit than Radzivil;
"by what right?"</p>

<p>"By that right ever recognized by the world&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
right of the strong," returned Zabern. "By open diplomacy
and by secret intrigue, Russia has failed to sap the
independence of Czernova; therefore she now resorts to
the sword."</p>

<p>"And the foe without will be aided by traitors within,"
murmured the princess.</p>

<p>"If," said Zabern, with a glance of inquiry at Barbara,
"if the Russians should enter our territory&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"We shall not cry 'quarter.' We shall meet them in
arms."</p>

<p>"But, your Highness," remonstrated Radzivil, in a
tone of dismay, "what hope have we of defeating them?"</p>

<p>"Very little," replied Barbara, "but what then, Count?
Would you have me be as a saint upon cathedral window
with folded hands and downcast eyes? Meekly submit
to see my realm filched from me? Never! So long as
there shall remain to me a man and a musket, so long will
I offer resistance."</p>

<p>"Will not your Highness assemble the cabinet and the
Diet?" asked the premier.</p>

<p>"And listen to timid, divided, or traitorous counsels?
No! Marshal, you are the head of the army; give immediate
orders for our troops to proceed to the frontier.
Take what steps you deem best for the defence of the
principality."</p>

<p>"Shall your Highness delay your coronation?" inquired
Radzivil.</p>

<p>"And show Russia that we fear her? No. Let not
the ceremony be delayed by so little as one hour. And
when the solemnity is over then will I proceed direct from
the cathedral to the camp. To arms! To arms! This
last fragment of Poland shall not fall without making
a valiant stand."</p>

<p>"There spake the spirit of your ancestors, the Jagellons,"
said Zabern. "Princess, you should have been
born a man."
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XV<br /><br />
THE EVE OF THE CORONATION</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>

<p>The dusk of a lovely autumnal eve had fallen over
Slavowitz. Lights were beginning to twinkle
along the boulevards.</p>

<p>The preparations for the coronation were complete.
The clinking of the carpenter's hammer had ceased; the
last bench had been put up; the last flag hung out. The
streets had become fairy arcades festooned with flowers
and colored lamps.</p>

<p>Crowds of sight-seers were abroad viewing the city
decorations.</p>

<p>A numerous throng, composed principally of peasants
from the more remote parts of Czernova, and who had
never before seen their princess, moved to and fro in front
of the Vistula Palace, calling for a sight of their fair
ruler; and Barbara, responsive to their desire, appeared
at intervals on the balcony smiling her acknowledgments,
and occasionally waving a scarf&mdash;an action which drew
forth rounds of applause.</p>

<p>The gayly decorated capital, brilliant with light, resonant
on all sides with song and music, alive with an ever-moving,
laughing populace, formed a picture difficult to
associate with coming disaster.</p>

<p>"So hath many a city looked on the eve of its fall,"
murmured Barbara, as she turned away from the window.
"Oh, Paul, why are you not with me? If you have
a plan for the salvation of Czernova, now is the time for
putting it forth."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>

<p>By means of swift couriers despatched at intervals of
every hour the princess was kept informed of the movements
that were taking place along the frontier.</p>

<p>Early in the day the Russian army&mdash;horse, foot, and
artillery&mdash;with the Czar Nicholas at its head, had set
forward from Zamoska, and was now encamping within
a mile of the Czernovese border. East and west for many
a furlong stretched the armed line of one hundred thousand
men. The Paulovski and Semenovski Guards were
there, the most splendid in the imperial service; as well
as the Tartar Guards, the Finland Guards, and other
regiments drawn from the motley nationalities that compose
the vast empire of the Czar. Picturesque Circassians,
clad in silver mail, and mounted upon fiery steeds,
pranced proudly along to the camping-ground marked
out for them, discharging their pistols at the sun in the
exuberance of their glee at the prospect of fighting and
pillage.</p>

<p>Wild-looking Cossacks riding shaggy ponies were continually
galloping up to the frontier-line with defiant cries
as if challenging the Czernovese sentinels to fire; after
which, with a menacing flourish of their lances they
would career back to their own camp.</p>

<p>Russian generals, stately and bearded, could be seen
standing on various points of elevated ground, coolly
reconnoitring through field-glasses, and studying the topography
of Czernova, as if purposing to conduct a campaign
in the principality.</p>

<p>Two envoys successively despatched by the princess to
the Russian camp to inquire into the meaning of these
sinister doings had failed to return. The obvious conclusion
was that they had been forcibly detained.</p>

<p>Barbara had resolved at all hazards to defend her
throne; and accordingly, while a body of ten thousand
troops was retained at Slavowitz for the preservation of
order during the coronation, a second division of ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
thousand, with Dorislas in command, had made their way
to the frontier. Under the personal supervision of Zabern,
artillery had been planted upon all the strategic
points that commanded the road to Slavowitz.</p>

<p>It was a critical time. The Czernovese army lay encamped
within sight of a force whose numerical superiority
was as ten to one. On each side of the frontier
Polish and Russian sentinels paced not one hundred
yards apart; a chance shot from either side might easily
bring on hostilities.</p>

<p>The princess's ministry lived in hourly dread of invasion,
and though striving to put a bold front upon the
matter, were secretly convinced that the sands of Czernovese
liberty were fast running out.</p>

<p>In the midst of a melancholy revery, Barbara learned
that the Duke of Bora was in the palace, desirous of an
interview with her. She was not unprepared for his coming,
and stern was her face as she descended to the White
Saloon where the duke was in waiting.</p>

<p>At the foot of the staircase she was met by the captain
of the palace-guard, who requested the watchword for
the night; and taking the proffered tablet, the princess
returned it inscribed with the words, "Fatherland and
Liberty."</p>

<p>Lifting her eyes she perceived Zabern by her side.</p>

<p>"The duke has come," she whispered.</p>

<p>"All is ready," replied the marshal.</p>

<p>As Barbara entered the White Saloon, the duke bowed
with a scarcely disguised smile of triumph. The recent
Russian movement, as the princess had secret reason to
know, was directed in his interests; with pitying grace
he came as a sort of conqueror to make his terms with
her.</p>

<p>Great at swordsmanship, Bora was not very shrewd in
other matters, and none but a fool would have ventured
to play the game that he was playing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span></p>

<p>"I have come, fair cousin," he began, undeterred by
her cold manner, "to remind you of your promise so
frequently made&mdash;your promise to marry me."</p>

<p>Barbara made no reply, but regarded him with a look
of sovereign disdain on her beautiful face.</p>

<p>"It is true," continued Bora, airily, "that you gave
what you were pleased to call your final decision some
weeks ago; still, the logic of events often compels one to
revoke a decision."</p>

<p>"And why do you deem the present a favorable time
for renewing your suit? What is this logic of events?"</p>

<p>Bora smiled mysteriously.</p>

<p>"I will say no more than this," he remarked, "that
you will certainly live to regret the rejection of my
suit."</p>

<p>"You evade my question. Let me then express what
is in your mind. My lord, by favor of the Czar, you expect
to reign over Czernova; you seek to usurp my
throne. But knowing that so long as I live, your throne
would always be insecure, you would make me your wife,
not from love, not from generosity or pity, but merely
to give validity to your title. Have I not read your
cowardly motive aright?"</p>

<p>She had&mdash;accurately.</p>

<p>Unaware how much the princess had learned of his
secret dealings, the fatuous Bora had come in the full
assurance that the approach of a Russian army and the
consequent rumors of annexation would have disposed
her to welcome his suit as a means of retaining her throne.
He now perceived his error. The princess was not so
timid a person as he had thought. Her stern manner
somewhat alarmed him. He began to regret his imprudence
in thus venturing into her presence.</p>

<p>"In short, your grace, marriage with you is the only
thing that can save me from deposition. Is not that what
you would say?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<p>"You reject my suit? Good! Then let this interview
terminate," said Bora, rising as if to depart.</p>

<p>The princess restrained him by a haughty gesture.</p>

<p>"Keep your seat, or I shall call the guard."</p>

<p>The duke obeyed, trembling now for his own safety.
Never had he seen the princess looking so angry.</p>

<p>"Why, during the past twelve months, have you insulted
me with vows of love, with offers of marriage?"</p>

<p>"Insulted? Why that word?" said the duke, striving
to conceal his alarm under an assumption of dignity.</p>

<p>"Because while simulating affection for me you were
secretly intriguing with my enemies."</p>

<p>"You have been listening to the aspersions of Zabern."</p>

<p>"I have been listening to the words of Lipski. Ah!
you start, my lord, and well you may. You are not yet
aware&mdash;for the affair was carried out very quietly&mdash;that
a raid was made this afternoon upon Lipski's premises.
His cellars were found to contain a vast store of
arms. In the house, too, was a number of Russian agents,
among them the spy, Ivan Russakoff. Lipski has made
full confession."</p>

<p>"Of what?" muttered the duke, looking thunderstruck
at the princess's statement.</p>

<p>"Of many things. Here is one. About a twelve-month
ago there was established a new journal entitled
the 'Kolokol,' mainly devoted to the libelling of myself
and to the stirring-up of civil strife. Before the founding
of that newspaper the Muscovites of Russograd were as
loyal and law-abiding as the Poles themselves; under the
influence of the 'Kolokol,' however, they have become
restless, disorderly, inclined to sedition. Was that well
done, John Lilieski?"</p>

<p>"What has this to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Much, for though Lipski might be editor, yet he who
actually owned the paper, financed it, and secretly controlled
its policy was none other than the Duke of Bora."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p>"A fable of Lipski's, invented to please the princess's
ministers."</p>

<p>"We will see whether you adhere to that statement in
the presence of Lipski, for you shall have the opportunity
of facing your accuser. He likewise avers that his measure,
the Secular Appropriation Bill, was in reality your
work; he simply acted as your mouthpiece in the Diet.
The money with which he corrupted the deputies was
supplied by you, and came from Orloff, the governor-general
of Warsaw."</p>

<p>"A falsehood. I affirm the story to be a falsehood."</p>

<p>"You devised a plot for the destruction of the Czernovese
Charter. You wrote to Orloff desiring him to obtain
the Czar's sanction for this scheme&mdash;a scheme which
was, however, happily frustrated," added Barbara, not
knowing how widely she erred from the truth.</p>

<p>"Lipski has been terrorized into saying whatever Zabern
wishes," muttered the duke, moistening his dry lips
with his tongue.</p>

<p>He saw that his treason had become known and proved;
and for such treason as his there could be but one punishment&mdash;death!
He glanced around the apartment, wondering
whether her guards were really within call. In
his desperation he would not have hesitated at slaying
her, if by that deed he could have effected his escape.</p>

<p>Barbara drew forth a handkerchief marked with a
dreadful dark stain. Instead of regarding it with a
shudder as might have been expected, she pressed it affectionately
to her lips.</p>

<p>"The blood of Trevisa," she said solemnly, "of Trevisa,
the most faithful and loyal of my servants&mdash;slain
at your instigation. Russakoff was paid to do the deed by
Lipski, but Lipski took his instructions from the Duke
of Bora."</p>

<p>"It's a lie."</p>

<p>"Katina Ludovska, though at the time she did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
clearly see Lipski's face, has to-day recognized him by
his voice, as the man who at the inn&mdash;Sobieski's Rest&mdash;offered
to Russakoff the bribe of four hundred roubles.
I have had Lipski brought here purposely to meet you.
He is in the palace at the present moment. Your grace,
come with me," said the princess, rising and motioning
Bora to follow her. "Let me see you meet him with a
denial. None more glad than I if you will do this. Come.
Dare you?"</p>

<p>It seemed not. He shrank back from accompanying
the princess to the adjoining ante-room, where sat both
his miserable accomplice Lipski and the equally miserable
Russakoff, each under the guard of a quaternion of
soldiers.</p>

<p>"You virtually admit your guilt in refusing to face
your accuser. The muskets found on Lipski's premises
have been surreptitiously forwarded by Orloff with your
knowledge and approval. To-morrow before break of
day those arms were to have been distributed to a Muscovite
mob rendered valiant by copious supplies of vodka.
At a certain point along the intended route of the coronation
procession, barricades were to be thrown up, and
when firing and rioting had begun, a message was to be
despatched to the camp of the Czar, urging him to come
and save the Muscovites from massacre at the hands of
the Poles. And the Czar, responsive to the appeal, would
come to establish in Czernova what he would call a stable
government, its stability to consist in the acceptance of
his own suzerainty and in the establishment of his kinsman
Bora upon the throne. The deposed princess might
marry Bora, if she chose; if not, there is in Ladoga's
gray lake an island fortress named Schlusselburg; there
let her pass the remainder of her days. Such is the programme
you would fain carry out to-morrow. My lord
of Bora, you have played a dark game; it is time you
received your reward."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p>The princess clapped her hands quickly, and at the
sound every door of the White Saloon opened and
through each there came marching a file of soldiers, two
abreast. With quick silent footfall they advanced over
the velvet carpet, and with a thrill of awe the duke perceived
that all were carrying their arms reversed as at a
funeral.</p>

<p>Deploying in their advance the files so moved as to
form a double ring around the princess and the duke, and
there they stood, terrible in their rigidity and silence.</p>

<p>The circle gave way and Zabern appeared, a chilling
glare in his eye. At a sign from him one soldier with a
swift motion pulled the duke's hands behind him, and in
a moment more had corded his wrists, while a second
pinned upon his breast a piece of white satin in shape like
a heart.</p>

<p>At sight of this dreadful fabric designed to direct the
aim of a firing party, the duke's courage fled; his knees
smote together; he grew white to the very lips.</p>

<p>Only ten miles distant were one hundred thousand men
ready to assist him to a throne; for all the aid they could
now give him they might as well have been situated in the
planet Mars.</p>

<p>"The firing-party awaits you in the quadrangle," said
Zabern, as the guards closed up around the duke.
"Forward!"</p>

<p>"Have a care what you do, Cousin Natalie," said Bora,
scarcely able to speak from fear. "You will have to
answer to the Czar for this."</p>

<p>"You speak treason with your last breath," said Barbara.
"Answer to the Czar for executing a traitor in my
own principality! What jurisdiction hath the Czar in
Czernova?"</p>

<p>"Traitor!" cried Zabern, fiercely. "I would stab you
with my own hand, though the Czar himself were by. To
the quadrangle&mdash;forward!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p>The murmur of the restless populace without penetrated
to the interior of the palace, and was heard by the
wretched duke. Was he to die with the sound of the
coronation-mirth ringing in his ears?</p>

<p>In the ante-chamber Zabern halted his troop and returned
to the side of the princess.</p>

<p>"This instrument lacks your Highness's signature,"
he remarked, presenting her with the warrant for the
duke's execution.</p>

<p>"On occasions such as this," murmured Barbara, taking
the document, "one is tempted to say with Saint
Vladimir, 'Who am I that I should shed blood?'"</p>

<p>"And yet Vladimir shed a good deal, if history speak
truth," responded Zabern, "and therefore became he a
saint after Russia's own heart. Your Highness, this is
no time for pity. It is a question of your life or the
duke."</p>

<p>The princess appended a name to the warrant.</p>

<p>"I fear," observed Zabern, with a grave smile, "that
the captain of the firing-party will question the authority
of that signature."</p>

<p>The princess looked, and to her surprise saw that she
had subscribed herself not "Natalie Lilieski," but "Barbara
Tressilian!" She had unwittingly written her
mother's maiden name.</p>

<p>She did not erase the signature, but proceeded to indite
a fresh warrant. She wrote very slowly, pondering as
she wrote. What would the real Natalie have thought,
said, or done, if she were living now and saw her elder
sister signing the death-warrant of her lover?</p>

<p>With a sigh she handed the document to the marshal,
who immediately returned it with a very strange look.
And there, staring at her from the paper, were the self-same
words as before&mdash;"Barbara Tressilian!"</p>

<p>The princess had her superstitious moments, and this
was one of them. That she should unintentionally have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
written the same twice seemed a confirmation of the
misgiving that had troubled her for several weeks.</p>

<p>"This is the hand of heaven," she murmured, in a tone
of awe, and laying down the pen. "Are not the illegitimate
always called after their mother? I have written
my true name. Marshal," she added in a fearful whisper,
"it is Bora who should be on the throne, and I should be
the prisoner of the Citadel."</p>

<p>"Your Highness, do not talk thus."</p>

<p>But Barbara paid little heed.</p>

<p>"I am tempted to summon the Diet, even at this late
hour, and to reveal to them my secret history, the whole
miserable story of my birth."</p>

<p>"You will bring ruin on Czernova if you do. What
guarantee have you that the cardinal's story is true?"</p>

<p>"This," replied Barbara, pointing to her signature on
the death-warrant.</p>

<p>The marshal shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"And therefore, because you suspect yourself to be of
illicit birth, you would tender your diadem to an assassin
and a traitor. Then let the Czar himself lay down his
power; true, he is the son of the Emperor Paul, but was
Paul really the child of Peter III.? Catherine and Soltikoff,
the chamberlain, could best answer that question.
Princess, you are over-scrupulous. Your title to the
throne is founded on a better right than that of the accident
of birth. The sovereign rules by the will of the
people, and are not the majority on your side? If the
princely office were made elective, is there any candidate
who would have the least chance of success against yourself?
And, <i>vox populi, vox Dei</i>. What other sanction do
you require?"</p>

<p>"The sanction of my own conscience. And to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow,"
she murmured in a tone of distress,
"after taking the Holy Sacrament I must lay my hand
upon the Charter&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>"Upon a forged document, rather," muttered Zabern,
grimly to himself.</p>

<p>"And declare that 'I, Natalie Lilieska, do solemnly
vow' to maintain its provisions, knowing that I am not
Natalie Lilieska. No, Zabern, I cannot&mdash;I will not
utter this falsehood."</p>

<p>"Then let the Pope avow himself a liar when in solemn
conclave he assumes the style of Pio Nono, and ignores
his true name of Giovanni Mastai."</p>

<p>"All men know of the Pope's change of name; there is
no attempt at deception; but I claim to be other than I
am. If I were certain of illegitimacy I would resign
my power this very night."</p>

<p>"I see quite plainly," said Zabern, speaking with more
freedom than he had hitherto employed towards the princess,
"that if Czernova were handed over to the Czar, and
your faithful ministers sent to Siberia, you would be very
well content."</p>

<p>As he spoke the marshal drew his sabre.</p>

<p>"Do you bid me break the sword that has been so long
used in the Polish cause? Must I retire hence to aid the
Hungarians, to obtain that freedom which you would
deny to us in Czernova?"</p>

<p>"No, marshal, no; we must not part. I will stand by
those who have stood by me. Clinging to the hope that
there is no dishonor on my name, I will hold to my
crown."</p>

<p>"A wise decision, princess," replied Zabern, considerably
relieved by her words. "And now as to the duke's
execution."</p>

<p>"What, marshal? Would you have me sign his death-warrant
when I am doubtful of my right to rule?&mdash;and
sign it, too, in the name of one, who, strange as it may
seem to us, loved him? No, I cannot sign this document
with the name of Natalie."</p>

<p>"But your Highness cannot sign it with any other."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I will not sign it at all."</p>

<p>"I greatly fear that your Highness will live to regret
this clemency."</p>

<p>"Be it so."</p>

<p>The first glow of Barbara's anger had passed, and she
listened to the voice of prudence. Though the duke richly
merited death, yet his execution without trial would give
the Czar a very convenient pretext for intervening in the
affairs of Czernova.</p>

<p>"By shooting the duke I make the Czar the heir to my
crown," said Barbara. "By retaining him alive I may be
able to make use of his person as a pawn on the political
chessboard. Imprisonment will be the wiser course.
Remove the duke to the Citadel."</p>

<p>And inasmuch as the marshal recognized Barbara as
his princess, he had of necessity to obey.</p>

<p>When Zabern had seen the duke securely lodged in
a cell of the Citadel, he returned to the White Saloon,
where Barbara still lingered, wrapt in melancholy
thought.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, on entering the palace this note was
put into my hands."</p>

<p>Barbara glanced at the missive and saw that it contained
the following words: "Marshal, will you accord
the bearer of this an interview with the princess?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Paul
Woodville.</span>"</p>

<p>Barbara's melancholy vanished as if by enchantment.
Two months had now elapsed since Paul's departure, and
during that time she had received no message from him.
Now at last there seemed to be tidings.</p>

<p>"Who is the bearer, marshal?"</p>

<p>"One returned from the dead. A woman calling herself
'Jacintha of Castel Nuovo.' She is in the ante-room
at the present moment awaiting your Highness's
pleasure."</p>

<p>The mention of the name "Jacintha" almost drew a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
scream from the princess. She ordered the visitor to be
instantly admitted.</p>

<p>Barbara's character was not marked by the false pride
that is too often the accompaniment of rank and wealth.
She welcomed her humble visitor as warmly as she would
have welcomed a queen or empress. Jacintha had nursed
her back to life, and Barbara, mindful of this service, was
delighted to have the opportunity of making some return.</p>

<p>"My lady&mdash;your Highness, I should say," began
Jacintha, sinking upon her knees, "it is very untimely on
my part to visit you on the eve of your coronation, when
you are occupied&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear old nurse," said Barbara, raising Jacintha up
with a winning smile, "let me whisper a secret to you. I
want to forget my coronation, and your presence will
make me forget it. Sit here beside me, and let us talk of
the old days at Castel Nuovo."</p>

<p>Zabern would have withdrawn, but the princess bade
him stay.</p>

<p>"I had thought," continued Barbara, "that you had
perished in that dreadful earthquake. And Lambro?
Is he alive?"</p>

<p>"No, my la&mdash;your Highness. We were outside the
castle at the time of the calamity, for some previous rumblings
had alarmed us. When the great shock came
Lambro slipped into a fissure that opened beneath his
feet. He went down before my very eyes, and the earth
closed over him immediately. How I myself escaped I
cannot tell, for the ground was opening and closing all
around me."</p>

<p>"Poor Lambro!" sighed Barbara, who had always entertained
a liking for the old Palicar, not knowing how
little he deserved her friendship. "And where have
you been living during the two past years?"</p>

<p>Jacintha's story, briefly stated, was as follows. After
the earthquake she had made her way to Trieste, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
thence by steamer to England. Within a few weeks of
her return she had had the good fortune to become housekeeper
in one of the ancient halls of Kent.</p>

<p>"But now will you not remain with me?" smiled the
princess.</p>

<p>"Your Highness will not wish it after you have heard
the whole of my story," replied Jacintha, and the strange
look which accompanied her words somehow caused all
Barbara's gladness to die away.</p>

<p>A few days previously Jacintha's master had bidden
her prepare for the coming of one of his friends, Captain
Woodville by name. What was her amazement to find in
her visitor none other than Captain Cressingham, who on
his part was equally astounded at meeting Jacintha. Paul
immediately fell to talking of the old days at Castel
Nuovo, and, among other matters, he questioned Jacintha
closely as to the young lady who had visited the castle
under the escort of Cardinal Ravenna. Jacintha learnt
from Paul that this lady was in reality the half-sister of
Barbara, and that both held the rank of princess. Then it
was that Jacintha resolved to tell Paul the true story of
Natalie's death.</p>

<p>"Ha!" muttered Zabern, foreseeing that his dark suspicion
was about to be verified.</p>

<p>"And Captain Woodville has sent you here to tell it to
me likewise&mdash;is it not so?" asked Barbara.</p>

<p>"Yes, your Highness. I wanted to put the story into
writing, that you might learn it in that way. I wanted
Captain Cressingham himself to tell it to you. But no;
he said it was better that you should hear it from my lips,
and he prevailed upon me to come here."</p>

<p>"Go on, Jacintha," said Barbara encouragingly, for
Jacintha seemed very loath to proceed.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, it is no wonder that the earthquake
came to swallow up the castle, for wicked doings took
place there. But do not blame me for my association with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
them. I loathed my position there, and would have run
away, but for the fear of Lambro and his mastiffs.
Now that you are a great princess, you will perhaps punish
me when you shall have heard the truth."</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville would not have sent you all the
way to Czernova, if he had thought that I should punish
you. Tell me the story of my sister's death. You have
my word beforehand that no hurt shall happen to you."</p>

<p>And Jacintha with a faltering tongue began a story, the
recital of which caused Barbara to thrill with horror.</p>

<p>"O Natalie, my sister! my sister!" she murmured,
when Jacintha had finished. "But for the cardinal, you
would still be living. His guilty love has driven one
sister to suicide, and now, opposed in his wicked desires,
he seeks to destroy the other. How can heaven permit
this man to live? Bora's guilt is innocence compared
with the guilt of Ravenna."</p>

<p>Powerless to allay the princess's grief, Zabern could
only watch her in sympathizing silence, and mentally renew
his vows of vengeance upon the cardinal. So full
was Barbara of this new sorrow that she seemed to have
forgotten Paul; at least she made no inquiries about him.</p>

<p>Zabern, however, leading Jacintha aside, quietly questioned
her as to the movements of the princess's late secretary.
It appeared that Paul had accompanied Jacintha
as far as Berlin, and had there put her in a train bound
for Czernova; seized with a sudden illness on the way,
she had been removed from the carriage at the first stopping-place,
and this circumstance had delayed her arrival
in Czernova by several days. Paul himself, on parting
from her, was going direct to St. Petersburg, a statement
which Zabern received with incredulity.</p>

<p>"St. Petersburg? Are you certain?"</p>

<p>Yes, Jacintha was quite certain.</p>

<p>"St. Petersburg," muttered Zabern. "Not three
months ago the Russians were demanding his extradition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
and now does he venture into the country of his enemies?
If his passport is made out in the name of Paul Woodville,
he is a doomed man; they will never let the defender
of Tajapore depart. This is something I can't
understand."</p>

<p>Though closely interrogated by Zabern, Jacintha was
unable to throw any light upon the motives that had
prompted Paul to visit Russia.</p>

<p>The marshal paced uneasily to and fro.</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville," he murmured, "pledged his
solemn word to be in Czernova on the coronation eve;
for, forewarned by me, he had reason to believe that the
princess's crown depended upon his sword. But he has
not yet appeared. His absence has something sinister in
it, for it is certain that he would be here if he could.
True, his presence in one sense has now become unnecessary,
inasmuch as the duke being a prisoner in the
Citadel will be unable to appear in the cathedral to-morrow
to challenge the princess's rights, and to defy her to
mortal combat by deputy. But as Woodville can know
nothing of the duke's imprisonment, why does he not
hasten to the supposed aid of the princess? I greatly
fear that our champion is himself a prisoner."</p>

<p>At this point intimation was given by the chamberlain
that one of Zabern's familiars, privileged to enter the
palace at all hours, was in the anteroom, desirous of a
word with the marshal.</p>

<p>Zabern withdrew from the White Saloon, and returned
after a minute's absence with the tidings for which he had
been waiting all day.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, my spy appointed to watch the cardinal
in his journeying to and fro from Rome reports that
his Eminence has just arrived at Slavowitz, bringing with
him the papal bull which deposes the Princess of Czernova,
and absolves her subjects from their allegiance."</p>

<p>"Say, rather, bringing with him his own death-warrant,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
cried Barbara, with a blaze of wrath unusual in
her.</p>

<p>"Your Highness gives me leave to deal with the cardinal
as I please," whispered Zabern, tapping the hilt of
his sabre significantly.</p>

<p>Barbara made no reply.</p>

<p>The marshal interpreting her silence as consent, stole
quietly from the apartment.
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XVI<br /><br />
THE CRIME THAT FAILED</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>The coronation eve was drawing to a close as
Pasqual Ravenna, Cardinal Archbishop of Czernova,
sat in the library of his archiepiscopal palace
in company with a young priest, Melchior by name.</p>

<p>One of the points which had wounded the pride of
Ravenna in time past had been the refusal of Abbot
Faustus, of the Convent of the Transfiguration, to submit
his monastery to a visit of inspection from the cardinal.
Though ecclesiastically the superior, Ravenna was unable
to enforce compliance from the sturdy abbot, who claimed
to be independent in virtue of an ancient bull granted by
Pius the Second. Even a mild admonition from the
regnant Pope had failed to produce any effect.</p>

<p>The cardinal had begun to suspect that Faustus's defiance
was prompted by other motives than the desire to
maintain his independence; there was some secret connected
with this monastery, a secret in which the princess
herself was involved; and accordingly he had deputed
the priest Melchior, whose crafty character well qualified
him for the work, to discover, if possible, the mystery that
lay hidden behind the walls of the Convent of the Transfiguration.</p>

<p>And now, in the first hour of the cardinal's return from
Rome, Melchior had come to report the results of his
investigations, results which were highly satisfactory to
Ravenna.</p>

<p>"So," he murmured, when the other had unfolded his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
discoveries, "a conspiracy for the emancipation of Poland,
a conspiracy to which Ravenna must not be admitted,
such being the express command of the princess.
'The cardinal is not to be trusted.' Ha! The place
then is no true monastery but an arsenal, a treasury, and
a repository for treasonable documents. This explains
the conduct of Faustus in excluding me from his convent.
Favored by the princess, he has grown insolent,
and would usurp my place at the coronation. To-morrow
he will rue his defiance when he sees his monastery in the
hands of Russian soldiery. The Czar's army lies conveniently
near for the seizure. How did you learn all
these details, Melchior?"</p>

<p>"From a kinsman of mine, a monk in this same convent.
In a conversation with him I stated my belief that
his monastery was utilized as a secret rendezvous for
Polish patriots. After some hesitation he admitted as
much; and then, won over by my professions of patriotism,
he revealed to me the length and breadth of the
conspiracy."</p>

<p>"Melchior, you have done well, and shall not go unrewarded."</p>

<p>The priest expressed his gratitude by an ugly smile,
and then with a look of cunning he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your Eminence, I have discovered something more.
We Czernovese have lost our title to autonomy. The
Charter has been destroyed, and the princess's ministers
are doing their best to keep the matter a secret."</p>

<p>"Ha! how do you know this?" said Ravenna, surprised
beyond measure at the statement.</p>

<p>"The Charter was burnt by two sentinels whose duty
it was to guard the Eagle Tower. They were traitors in
the pay of Russia. By the waving of a blue lamp they
signalled the successful accomplishment of the work to
a confederate concealed in the palace grounds, who immediately
conveyed the news to Orloff, the governor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Warsaw. This confederate returned to Slavowitz a few
weeks ago. He is a Catholic, it seems, regular at confessional.
Being troubled with the thing called conscience,
and desiring to be absolved from his guilt, he
revealed the matter to his father confessor Virgilius,
who, in turn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Revealed it to you," interrupted the Cardinal, his
surprise yielding to delight, for the news furnished him
with another weapon to be used against the princess.
"What has become of the two who destroyed the
Charter?"</p>

<p>"They have never been seen since the night of the
deed. Doubtless they are now in Russia enjoying a pension
from the Czar's ministers. Oh! your eminence,
there can be no doubt as to the truth of the story. Orloff
himself came as envoy to Slavowitz; he boldly declared
in the presence of the princess and her ministers that the
Czernovese Charter was a myth, and non-existent; and&mdash;here
is the significant point&mdash;her Highness and Zabern
did not refute him by producing the Charter, but
took refuge in evasions."</p>

<p>"But, Melchior," observed the cardinal with perplexed
air, "you must be in error. This evening the iron coffer
containing the Charter was conveyed to the Cathedral
under a strong guard of soldiers. It plays a part in the
coronation-ritual."</p>

<p>Melchior smiled caustically.</p>

<p>"Your eminence, three little circumstances that have
happened of late may serve to throw a little light upon
what is contained in that coffer. Firstly, within a few
days after the destruction of the Charter, Zabern's mistress,
Katina Ludovska, made purchase of some parchment
at a stationer's in the Rue de Sobieski, and was
very critical as to its color, texture, and the like. Secondly,
this same Katina was for several days in an apartment
of the Vistula Palace occupied in writing. Thirdly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
as you are aware, our <i>Museum Czernovium</i> contains a
collection of historical documents, among them autograph
letters of several Czars, and&mdash;what is more pertinent to
the occasion&mdash;an imperial ukase bearing the signature,
'<i>Buit po semu, Ickathrina.</i>&mdash;Be it so, Catherine.' Your
Eminence will doubtless remember that our Charter ended
with these same words, '<i>Buit po semu, Ickathrina</i>.' Now
it is a curious circumstance that this imperial ukase
should have vanished some weeks ago from its glass case
in the Museum; the curator is unable to account for its
disappearance, but probably Zabern can."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That any one wishing to imitate the signature of
Catherine would find the task facilitated by having this
ukase before him. Your Eminence, doubt it not that the
document to be laid upon the altar to-morrow is a forgery.
Count Orloff in the character of ambassador will be present
at the coronation. A word to him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough," interrupted Ravenna with an exultant smile.
"This shall to the Czar. Here's matter sufficient to depose
the princess. Within twenty-four hours the iron
hand of Russia will be pressing the principality."</p>

<p>"True. And yet," said Melchior, somewhat puzzled to
account for his master's attitude, "and yet when that happens
what place will there be for a Roman archbishop?"</p>

<p>"None: and therefore after to-morrow I quit this
barbarous principality for Italy, leaving without reluctance,
for, you know, I never was a Pole. The Pope has
appointed me to the See of Palestrina. You shall accompany
me, Melchior, and the first rich benefice that becomes
vacant in my diocese shall be yours. Italia, Italia," said
the cardinal with a glow of enthusiasm, "where the skies
are sunny, the wines delicious, and the women&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More yielding than the cold dames of Czernova,"
smiled Melchior, well acquainted with his master's
character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<p>"The hour is late, and much remains to be done,"
observed Ravenna. "Melchior, you will call upon those
of the clergy whom I have named, and request their attendance
here at eight in the morning to listen to a rescript
from the Pope."</p>

<p>The priest bowed and quitted the apartment.</p>

<p>Left alone, the cardinal drew writing-materials towards
himself, and proceeded to indite a letter, a letter intended
for the perusal of no less a personage than the Czar Nicholas.
The contents of the missive were brief, but exceedingly
weighty.</p>

<p>In leisurely fashion, Ravenna went over what he had
written, and seemingly satisfied with the composition, he
proceeded to fold the paper several times; then selecting&mdash;and
not without reason as the sequel proved&mdash;an
extremely small envelope, he enclosed the letter within it.</p>

<p>The night was very warm; and the windows were open
to catch every breath of air. These windows overlooked
the gardens in the rear of the palace, for the cardinal's
library lay remote from the public street.</p>

<p>The sounds of distant revelry floated faintly on the air.
The Czernovese were not disposed to retire early on such
a festal eve as this. Many, indeed, were spending the
night in the streets for the purpose of securing a place
of vantage from which to view the coronation procession
next day.</p>

<p>Ravenna smiled cynically as he listened to the murmur
of the far-off voices.</p>

<p>"The morrow shall see your mirth turned to mourning,"
he muttered.</p>

<p>The letter accidentally dropped from his hand as he was
in the act of affixing his seal of the paschal lamb. He let
it lie, while with closed eyes he leaned back in his chair,
picturing his triumph of the morrow. In fancy he could
see the princess led off, a pale, silent, drooping captive
under an escort of Russian soldiers, and the Duke of Bora
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
enthroned in the cathedral amid the shouting of the Czar's
legions.</p>

<p>"Barbara Lilieska," he said aloud, and with his eyes
still closed, "you shall regret your insolence in putting
an affront upon me in the sight of Czernova."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that," said an ironical voice.</p>

<p>The one man in Czernova whom the cardinal least
desired to see on this particular night was Zabern; and
yet it was Zabern who had spoken!</p>

<p>With a sudden start Ravenna opened his eyes to find
the marshal standing with folded arms upon the other
side of the table. Behind him was his orderly, Nikita. A
third man, a trooper named Gabor, was in the act of locking
the door of the apartment. Alive to his peril, the cardinal
struck repeatedly at a bell upon the table.</p>

<p>"Of no use," remarked Zabern, with an ice-cold smile.
"There is no one in the house but your steward, who is
keeping watch at the foot of the staircase. He has lately
become a spy in my service. He has just dismissed your
household, bidding them go forth to view the city decorations.
They will not return for an hour at least&mdash;ample
time for our work."</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"Your life."</p>

<p>Ravenna could not suppose that Zabern had come for
anything else; nevertheless, the cool, frank avowal sent
the blood to his heart with a rush.</p>

<p>"You would murder me?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Call it murder if you will. Execution is my term."</p>

<p>"What is my trespass?"</p>

<p>"'Stolen waters are sweet.' Strange text for holy
cardinal to address to youthful princess. You comprehend?
Do you ask, then, why you should die?"</p>

<p>So all was known to these men. What mercy could he
expect? He glanced from one to the other, but saw no
pity in their stern, set faces. The trio had come to do a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
bloody work, and would do it. He strove to keep a cool
head; he tried to reason with his would-be assassins.</p>

<p>"You will have to answer for what you do."</p>

<p>"To the saints above&mdash;yes; and I am ready. At the
bar of God I'll rest my title to heaven on the holy deed I
do to-night. To a human tribunal&mdash;no, for none shall
know that you have been killed by others. Behold!"</p>

<p>Zabern, as he spoke, drew forth a small cut-glass phial,
half-full of a liquid resembling distilled water. The
silver cap bore the inscription, "The Manna of Saint
Nicholas."</p>

<p>"<i>Aqua Tophania</i>," continued the marshal. "Ah! you
start? You recognize the phial? Yes, it has been taken
from a secret drawer of your own cabinet. Why a holy
cardinal should have poison in his possession is best known
to himself. I can, however, testify to its efficacy, for the
condemned criminal upon whom I experimented to-day
died within five minutes. Pasqual Ravenna, your servants
on their return will find you leaning over the table dead,
clutching this empty phial in your hand. To-morrow all
Slavowitz will be discussing the suicide of the cardinal
archbishop. Your nephew, Redwitz of Zamoska, may
send off his three sealed packets, and very much surprised
the recipients will be to find nothing within them but
blank papers, for the originals have been abstracted, read
by the princess, and burnt."</p>

<p>Like one dazed by a heavy blow, Ravenna stared vacantly
at the speaker, and then his eye, mechanically sinking
lighted upon something white near his feet. It was
the letter that he had recently written. The sight of it
suddenly quickened his blood and suggested a plan for
outwitting his assassins. He was still seated at the table,
and with his foot he gently pushed the letter forward till
it lay concealed beneath the fringe of the overhanging
damask cloth.</p>

<p>Upon the table itself there lay before him a document
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
almost as dangerous as the letter. This was a roll of
vellum with papal seals attached. It was beyond him to
conceal this document from Zabern, whose face was set
upon it with grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>"What have we here?" he cried, stooping over the
table, and lifting the vellum. "The papal bull, as I live,"
he continued, glancing his eye rapidly over the document,
and reading snatches from it. "'We, Pio Nono
 ... do herewith commission our faithful brother in
Christ, Pasqual Ravenna'&mdash;Angels of light! such
names mingled! Christ and Ravenna!&mdash;'commission
him to pronounce sentence of anathema and excommunication
against the so-called Natalie Lilieska,'&mdash;so-called,
so-called," muttered Zabern, stopping in his reading
with a sudden fear, and hardly daring to continue the
perusal; "what does that mean?&mdash;'in that while
claiming to be lawful Princess of Czernova, and a
daughter of the True Church, she is an impostor who
 ...' Oh, devil that you are!" cried Zabern, breaking off,
and grinding his teeth in anger, "so you have told that
story to the Pope?"</p>

<p>"It is known to all the Vatican," replied Ravenna,
hoping that the knowledge of the fact would restrain
Zabern from his dreadful purpose. "The Pope will
understand why I am murdered, and to whom the deed
should be ascribed. You will do well to pause and
reflect."</p>

<p>Zabern's face grew terrible in its expression, as he realized
the desperate strait to which Barbara was now
reduced. If the Pope were master of her secret, not only
could he anathematize, but he had likewise the power of
deposing her whenever he chose.</p>

<p>"'Pause and reflect'?" said Zabern, repeating Ravenna's
words. "Why, this disposes me more than ever
to slay you. What motive have I for keeping you alive?
So, cardinal," he continued, after a brief pause, "you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
would have come to the coronation, robed in full canonicals,
with the Latin clergy of Czernova at your back,
to interdict Abbot Faustus from performing the ceremony,
to read the Pope's rescript, and to anathematize the princess
with bell, book, and candle. Vain your hopes! This
papal bull shall not be read in the cathedral to-morrow,
for here is the end of it."</p>

<p>With these words Zabern raised the document to the
flame of the candelabrum, and there held it till the vellum
had shrivelled to blackened flakes.</p>

<p>"That the Pope should sign his name to such rhodomontade!"
he muttered contemptuously. "He threatens
us; let him beware of his own downfall. The House of
Savoy shall be our avengers. The Sardinian king will
never rest till he himself shall reign at Rome."</p>

<p>A prediction destined to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Zabern, resolving to show cause for the slaying of Ravenna,
seated himself in a chair, rested his elbow upon
the table, his face upon his hand, and glared across the
crimson damask.</p>

<p>"Cardinal, when you told the Pope that story, did you
tell him the whole of it? How the Princess Natalie met
her death, for example?"</p>

<p>"The Princess Natalie committed suicide at Castel
Nuovo."</p>

<p>"True; and so you told her father, Prince Thaddeus,
but you did not tell him her reason for the act. Let us
hear it."</p>

<p>Ravenna was silent.</p>

<p>"The truth is that you had become possessed of unhallowed
desires towards that fair princess during your
tour with her around the shores of the Adriatic. When
at Zara you proposed a visit to your place, Castel Nuovo,
and the princess, doubting nothing, willingly accompanied
you. While there you made certain proposals to her,
who was so innocent in mind that she failed to understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
you, and wonderingly repeated your words to the housekeeper
Jacintha. Full well did Jacintha know your object
in bringing that young girl there. For, holy cardinal,
Natalie was not the first. You were ever eloquent in persuading
youthful widows and maidens to renounce the
world and to take the veil. It was your practice to escort
your victims to some convent in Dalmatia, and the journey
was always broken at Castel Nuovo. When your <i>protégées</i>
left that place they had good reason for wishing
to hide themselves in a convent.</p>

<p>"To such a point of depravity and recklessness had
your nature grown that you could not refrain, even where
a princess was concerned. At Castel Nuovo there was a
secret passage leading from your study to the chamber
where Natalie slept. In the silence and darkness of the
night you stole down to accomplish your wicked purpose.
When I think of the shame and horror of that poor girl's
awakening, her imploring words and cries&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point Nikita, thinking of his own youthful
daughter, who once upon a time had been almost persuaded
by Ravenna to adopt a conventual life, could no
longer restrain himself.</p>

<p>"Have at you!" he cried fiercely, drawing his sabre.</p>

<p>The stroke aimed by him at the cardinal's head was
intercepted by the sword of the quick-moving Zabern.</p>

<p>"Hold, Nikita. No clumsy work. No betrayal of
ourselves. Toffana's hell-drops will do the trick more
safely. Put up your weapon."</p>

<p>When the other had somewhat reluctantly obeyed,
Zabern resumed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Next morning the wretched princess, rendered completely
insane by the thought of her dishonor, staggered
through the secret passage, and after invoking the vengeance
of heaven upon you, she stabbed herself and so
died.</p>

<p>"By some means you prevailed upon Lambro and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Jacintha to maintain silence on the part played by you in
this tragedy. A message was sent to Prince Thaddeus,
who happened at this time to be at Zara. He came; wept
over his daughter's suicide; wondered what motive could
have prompted the deed, but never suspected the holy
cardinal. Pasqual Ravenna, do you deny the truth of
this?"</p>

<p>No answer came from the accused.</p>

<p>"Cardinal, such guilt as yours would be ill-atoned for
by an after-life of penance in monastic cell, in sackcloth
and ashes, with scourgings and with diet of bitter herbs.
But, untroubled by the crime, dead to the voice of conscience,
you mingle unashamedly with your fellow-men,
you aspire to play the statesman&mdash;nay, you hesitate not
to minister in the holiest rites of religion. Was it not
enough for you to have destroyed Natalie, but that you
must seek to draw her sister to your arms? And because
our princess would remain virtuous and good, you in
your black rage would come forward at the coronation
to-morrow, and, by lying words&mdash;for none know
better than yourself that she is the lawful daughter
of Thaddeus&mdash;you would seek to procure her dethronement.
Never slew I man yet, save with regret;
now for the first time do I take pleasure in killing a
fellow-mortal.</p>

<p>"Pasqual Ravenna, your last hour has come. To-night
shall Princess Natalie's dying cry be answered. The
maidens whom you have wronged shall be avenged."</p>

<p>Something glittered in Zabern's hand. It was a surgical
instrument of steel, designed for forcing open the
jaws of persons bent on keeping them shut.</p>

<p>Holding this dreadful instrument, together with the
poison-phial, in his left and only hand, Zabern motioned
Nikita and Gabor to grip the cardinal by the arms.</p>

<p>"Give me ten minutes, ten minutes only, in the next
apartment," gasped Ravenna.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>"For what purpose?"</p>

<p>"To&mdash;pray."</p>

<p>"I fail to see the use," responded Zabern dryly.
"Heavens! Nikita, how strangely constituted these
churchmen must be to think that a life of guilt may be
atoned for by ten minutes of prayer."</p>

<p>"As you yourself hope for mercy at the last day, I
beseech you to grant me ten minutes&mdash;five, then&mdash;in
the next room."</p>

<p>Zabern laid the steel and phial upon the table.</p>

<p>"You may have ten minutes' grace, but you will do
your praying here."</p>

<p>"That apartment is an oratory," pleaded Ravenna.</p>

<p>"Let him have his wish, marshal," said Gabor.</p>

<p>"And see him escape us?" ejaculated Nikita fiercely.</p>

<p>"I cannot escape. There is no exit from the oratory,
secret or open, save by that door. The window is fifty
feet from the ground."</p>

<p>Zabern, suspecting that Ravenna was trying to effect
his escape, approached the chamber in question, and
found it to be an oblong apartment, twenty feet by ten,
fitted up as an oratory, and hung with sacred pictures.
At the far end, through a casement of stained glass,
arrowy beams of tender silvery moonlight slanted upon
an altar, surmounted by an ivory crucifix with waxen
tapers burning before it. There was an air of solemnity
in the place which exercised an influence even upon the
stern mind of Zabern.</p>

<p>"Take your ten minutes," he exclaimed, pointing
within, "but seek not to escape, for my eye shall be on
you the while."</p>

<p>Ravenna rose from his seat; in rising he purposely
stumbled and fell, and while so doing he contrived to
secure possession of the letter lying beneath the table,
and to secrete it within the folds of his cassock. Then
with slow and faltering step he moved into the oratory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
and taking out his rosary, he knelt with bowed head
before the altar.</p>

<p>Zabern, standing without, kept the door slightly open
in order that he might not lose sight of Ravenna's
movements.</p>

<p>Gabor the trooper here put a very pertinent question.</p>

<p>"Marshal, since the Pope and his cardinals know the
princess's secret, what do we gain by killing the archbishop?"</p>

<p>"We stop his mouth from proclaiming the secret to-morrow,"
replied Zabern.</p>

<p>"True. But afterwards&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Afterwards, my good Gabor, no one shall be able to
say that our princess is not Natalie Lilieska. Was the
real Natalie marked with a mole upon her right shoulder?
A friendly physician can soon produce that disfigurement
for us upon the fair skin of our princess."</p>

<p>Nikita laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"Is there any one living who can defeat the marshal?"
he cried.</p>

<p>"There is one here who will make the attempt," said a
voice.</p>

<p>At this the trio stared curiously at one another, for the
words came from the oratory, and had plainly been uttered
by none other than the cardinal. Recovering from
his momentary surprise, Zabern, with sudden misgiving
at his heart, flung wide the door.</p>

<p>"Marshal Zabern," said the voice of Ravenna, "as you
value the throne of the princess, come not one step farther.
Mark well what is in my hand."</p>

<p>The window of the oratory, which before had been
shut, was now wide open, and the moonlight fell upon
the lofty figure and pale face of the cardinal, who was
standing erect on one side of the altar. In his right hand
he held a dove, to the neck of which a letter was attached.
The sight kept the three men dumb and motionless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
for they instantly divined that the bird was a carrier-pigeon.</p>

<p>Ravenna's Italian guile had been more than a match
for Zabern's subtlety. His object in kneeling before the
altar had not been to pray, but to release the dove which
had been attached to it by a silken thread&mdash;a dove purposely
kept for emergencies. What captain of the guard
on arresting the archbishop would be so stern-natured as
to refuse his prisoner a few minutes' prayer in his private
oratory? Ravenna, on releasing the dove, had affixed
the letter to its neck, performing the feat so guardedly,
that though he had been watched, now by Zabern, and
now by Nikita, his movements had not given rise to
suspicion.</p>

<p>"Listen," cried Ravenna, raising his left hand warningly.
"If you enter I quit my hold of the dove. You
observe the letter. Let me tell you what it contains."</p>

<p>"Say on," returned Zabern with affected indifference.
"Your ten minutes have not yet expired."</p>

<p>"This evening," began the cardinal, "and just prior to
your arrival I penned a letter intended for the Czar's
perusal. That letter now hangs from this dove's neck.
It contains three statements. Firstly, that the Princess of
Czernova is not Natalie Lilieska; secondly, that the Czernovese
Charter is a forgery from the hand of Katina
Ludovska; thirdly, that the Convent of the Transfiguration
contains ample evidence of a conspiracy for the
emancipation of Poland. Each of these facts, singly, if
known to the Czar, would be sufficient to hurl the princess
from her throne. If this dove should fly forth it would
be in my nephew's house at Zamoska within thirty minutes;
an hour more, and Redwitz would be in the camp
of the Czar. Thus, then, do I make my terms. Approach
to do me hurt, and I release the dove. Retire from the
palace, give me my life, and I swear by all that I hold
holy to refrain from endangering the throne of the princess.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
It is within your power to murder me, but the
murder will be dearly purchased, for it will bring utter
ruin upon Czernova."</p>

<p>"Idle vaunting!" said Zabern. "All know that the
carrier-pigeon flieth not in the dark."</p>

<p>"This dove has ere now found its way to Zamoska by
moonlight."</p>

<p>That the cardinal spoke truth when he declared that the
letter contained the weighty secrets Zabern did not doubt.
Therefore to advance with intent to slay would be fatal to
the interests of the princess; and yet to retire, leaving
Ravenna to his own devices would be equally fatal, for
Zabern knew full well that the cardinal's most solemn
oath was not to be trusted. So soon as the trio should
withdraw, so soon as Ravenna should be released from
the fear of their presence, he would laugh at their simplicity,
and would carry out his evil work against the
princess, ay, and with more determination than ever,
embittered as he would be by the attempt made upon
his life. It was a terrible dilemma.</p>

<p>The trio stood upon the threshold of the oratory, immovable,
irresolute, silent, gazing at the cardinal, who in
turn kept his eyes fixed upon them like a prisoner waiting
for the verdict of life or death.</p>

<p>"No terms with a Jesuit," muttered Zabern under his
breath. "Nikita, you are the best shot. Draw your
pistol, and shoot, not the cardinal, but the dove."</p>

<p>As Zabern spoke he moved slightly to one side, in order
to screen the movements of his henchman.</p>

<p>Directly afterwards a report rang out, startlingly loud
in that small chamber. It was accompanied by a sharp cry
of anguish from the cardinal, and by a swift forward
rush on the part of his foes, each eager to pounce upon
the fallen bird.</p>

<p>But, by a strange mischance, Nikita, who was considered
to be second only to Katina herself in the handling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
of the pistol, had somehow failed to hit a conspicuous object
seventeen feet away. The bullet had penetrated the
wrist of the cardinal, whose hand had involuntarily relaxed
its hold, with the result that the startled dove was
now flying forth through the open casement.</p>

<p>With the air of one mad, Zabern pulled Nikita towards
the window, and, hurling Ravenna aside, he thrust his
own pistol into the trooper's hand.</p>

<p>"Shoot, Nikita, shoot in God's name," he cried, pointing
to the dove, whose white form was clearly defined
against the dark blue sky. "The fate of all Czernova
rests on your aim."</p>

<p>The bird, as if doubtful what direction to take, was
moving slowly round in a series of spirals and rising
higher and higher each moment. Nikita pointed his
weapon, raising it gradually with the ascent of the dove,
till, deeming himself certain of his aim, he drew the trigger.
A second shot rang out. Both men looked, expecting
the instant fall of the dove, but the winged messenger
remained unhurt, and apparently having chosen its route,
flew off in a straight line, and immediately disappeared
over the tree-tops.</p>

<p>"By heaven, you've missed again!" cried Zabern, his
dismay being lost for the moment in wonder that Nikita's
hand should have so strangely lost its cunning.</p>

<p>"God's curse is on me to-night," said Nikita, flinging
the pistol from him. "Who," he added, with a touch of
Slavonic superstition, "who can shoot a dove, symbol of
the Holy Ghost?"</p>

<p>"Symbol of the holy devil!" cried Zabern. "Where's
the cardinal?"</p>

<p>In his eagerness to mark the effect of Nikita's second
shot Gabor had likewise pressed forward to the casement,
forgetful of Ravenna, who, taking advantage of this negligence,
picked himself up from the corner where Zabern
had flung him, and ran from the oratory into the library.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
The wondering police next day traced his course over the
carpet by the blood-drops that fell from his shattered
wrist.</p>

<p>But in a moment more the avenging Zabern was after
him, his sabre gleaming in his hand.</p>

<p>The cardinal had reached the locked door of the library:
his unwounded hand had turned the key; his fingers were
already upon the door-handle when Zabern, with a laugh
of horrid glee, clutched him by the collar of his cassock
with the same hand that held the sabre, and pulled him
backward upon his knees.</p>

<p>The agony of the situation forced from Ravenna a yell
that curdled the blood of the treacherous steward who
kept watch at the foot of the staircase, but it had no effect
upon Zabern.</p>

<p>"You paid no heed to Natalie's screams, nor will I to
yours."</p>

<p>He thought no more now of safeguarding himself by
imparting to the murder the appearance of suicide.</p>

<p>"To hell, and say that Zabern sent you."</p>

<p>Foaming with fury, he dealt not one, but many strokes
at the kneeling, swaying figure, with its feebly upraised
hands. Nikita and Gabor, equally frenzied, joined in the
savage work.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The three miserable men wiped their bloody sabres
upon the window-curtains, and stared down upon the
carpet at something which had once been a man.</p>

<p>The clock-tower of the cathedral now sent forth the
sweet and pretty carillon that always heralded the striking
of the hour. Then after a solemn interval came the
first peal of midnight.</p>

<p>"The princess's coronation day!" said Nikita.</p>

<p>"Humph! will there be any coronation?" muttered
Zabern.</p>

<p>"Hark to the shouting!" said Gabor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<p>From every quarter of the capital, from the groups
moving to and fro along the route of the intended procession,
from spacious square and narrow alley, from the
brilliantly illuminated hotel, and from the obscure private
dwelling, came the sound of cheering, gradually swelling
into one prolonged universal roar. The gala-day had
come at last!</p>

<p>Zabern with a grim smile looked towards the north.
The heaven in that direction was tinged with a red glow
from the thousands of watch-fires in the Czar's camp&mdash;that
camp towards which the swift-flying dove was now
winging its course with the tidings fatal to Czernova.
How long would it be ere that huge array came pouring
across the border to depose the princess, and to establish
the duke upon&mdash;</p>

<p>Zabern started.</p>

<p>Ere the shouting of the joyous populace had died away,
a new and startling sound was reverberating through the
night air. It was the boom of a single cannon, and that at
no great distance. Its significance was intuitively divined
by Zabern.</p>

<p>"The Citadel-gun!" he cried, recoiling from the window.
"By God, the duke has escaped!"</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XVII<br /><br />
THE BEGINNING OF THE CORONATION</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span></p>
<p>The morning of Barbara's coronation broke soft
and sunny; it seemed almost impossible that anything
disastrous could happen on a day so fair.</p>

<p>Prior to setting off for the cathedral the princess entertained
her ministers at breakfast. She herself occupied
the head of the table, with Radzivil at her right hand and
Zabern at the left. Dorislas was absent in command of
the ten thousand appointed to guard the frontier.</p>

<p>So far no hostilities had occurred. Successive couriers
arriving at intervals of every half-hour continued to report
that the Russian forces still preserved their position
of the previous afternoon,&mdash;a position about a mile distant
from the Czernovese border. There was no movement
on their part suggestive of coming invasion. The
more hopeful of the ministers, therefore, began to pluck
up courage, and tried to believe that the Czar's army had
really mustered for the customary autumn man&oelig;uvres,
and not for the purpose of preventing the coronation.</p>

<p>Zabern did not share in these hopeful views; none
knew better than he did the magnitude of the peril that
overhung Czernova. In reporting the cardinal's death
to the princess Zabern had suppressed some details, and
hence Barbara was unaware that a dove had flown off to
Zamoska bearing a letter, which, if it should reach the
Czar's hands, would most assuredly result in her dethronement.
From very pity he withheld the fact.</p>

<p>"She will learn it soon enough," he thought. "Why
add to evil the anticipation of it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>During the course of the breakfast many comments
were made upon the murder of Cardinal Ravenna.</p>

<p>"A terrible and mysterious affair!" said Radzivil,
greatly shocked by the tragedy, and completely ignorant
as to its authors. "The physicians assert that there are
no less than eighteen wounds upon the body."</p>

<p>"Five less than Julius Cæsar received," commented
Zabern irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"You offer a reward, I presume, for any information
that shall lead to the detection of the assassins?" said the
premier to Zabern, who, as Minister for Justice, was head
of the department that took cognizance of crime.</p>

<p>"Not a rouble note," replied Zabern bluntly.</p>

<p>"That's contrary to your usual practice."</p>

<p>"Why should I offer a reward when I know who the&mdash;ah!&mdash;assassins
are? There were three of them to the
deed."</p>

<p>"You know them? And yet they have not been
seized!"</p>

<p>"I have weighty reasons for deferring their arrest."</p>

<p>"Delay may end in their escape."</p>

<p>"The chief assassin cannot escape from me. The
police know him and have their eye upon him whenever
he walks abroad. I can put my finger upon him as easily
as I now lay hand upon this coat," said Zabern smiling,
and suiting the action to the word.</p>

<p>Radzivil was about to press for further enlightenment,
but Barbara checked him.</p>

<p>"The subject is distressing to me," she said with a look
that confirmed her words.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, I crave pardon," said the premier.</p>

<p>Though Barbara fully believed that no one had ever
merited death more than Ravenna, yet the deed lay heavy
on her mind. Not even the thought of the many maidens,
her own sister among the number, sacrificed to the unholy
desires of the cardinal, could blind her to the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
in sending Zabern to slay him she had committed a
crime.</p>

<p>No such scruple, however, troubled the conscience of
the marshal, whose only regret was that he had not despatched
the duke likewise, while it lay in his power to
do so.</p>

<p>Ere coming to the breakfast he had witnessed the execution
of the deputy Lesko Lipski and the spy Ivan Russakoff
with the feeling, however, that it was but sorry
justice to shoot the agents, while the more guilty principal
was at large.</p>

<p>"You have no tidings of Bora, I presume?" said Barbara
turning to the marshal.</p>

<p>"None&mdash;so far, your Highness," replied Zabern.
"But, oh!" he added with mingled surprise and satisfaction,
"here comes one who should be able to explain
the mystery of the duke's escape."</p>

<p>All eyes had turned towards a door which had just
opened, giving ingress to a file of soldiers; they were
under the command of Gabor, and escorted in their midst
Miroslav, the governor of the Citadel.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," said Gabor, advancing and saluting,
"I came upon the governor in the act of departing from
the city. Thinking that you might like to interview him,
I took the liberty of arresting him on my own authority."</p>

<p>"You have done well," replied Barbara; and then
turning a cold face upon the governor, she said: "What
defence have you to make, Miroslav? You received orders
to exercise special vigilance over your prisoner, the
Duke of Bora, and yet he contrived to escape."</p>

<p>"And with my connivance, so please your Highness."</p>

<p>"Traitor!" said Zabern, starting up, and half drawing
his sword, "you have signed your death-warrant."</p>

<p>"Your Highness, hear my story ere condemning me.
At eleven o'clock last night I was informed that a man
stood at the gate of the Citadel demanding an interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
with me. I sent to ascertain his name and business.
'Carry that to your master,' said the stranger, pencilling
a few words on a card, and enclosing it within an envelope.
On opening the envelope this is what I beheld."</p>

<p>Here Miroslav drew forth a small card, which Gabor
conveyed to the princess, who started at sight of the words
that were written upon it. She handed the note to Radzivil,
whose face immediately expressed the utmost consternation.
He tendered the card to Zabern, who in turn
passed it to the minister beside him, and thus amid a
death-like silence it went the round of the table.</p>

<p>And the words of the note were these,&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>You are herewith commanded to release the Duke of
Bora. Delay will mean death to you.</i></p>

<p class="left45"><i>NICHOLAS PAULOVITCH</i><br />
<span class="i6"><i>Czar of all the Russias.</i></span></p>

<p class="p2">"When I saw that signature," continued Miroslav, "I
gave orders that the visitor should be instantly admitted.
On entering the room he commanded my servant to retire,
and then when he had withdrawn the cloak from his
face I saw that it was indeed the Emperor Nicholas.
'Have you given command for the release of my kinsman?'
were his first words. Vain was it for me to protest
that I could receive such an order only from the
princess herself. 'I am the suzerain of Czernova, and
therefore above the princess,' was his reply."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Barbara, with a flash of her eyes. "And
you acknowledged his suzerainty?"</p>

<p>"Your Highness is great, but the Czar is greater.
Who is like the mighty Nicholas?"</p>

<p>"No one on earth, Miroslav; for which fact may the
saints be praised!" remarked Zabern.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, I was so awed by the emperor's
majestic presence, by his authoritative manner, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
thought of his empire and power that I could not do
otherwise than obey him. The marshal himself would
have done the like, had he been in my place."</p>

<p>Zabern repudiated the statement with a scornful laugh.</p>

<p>"I brought the duke to the presence of the emperor,
and the two withdrew, going I know not where. Fearing
your Highness's displeasure, I myself quitted the Citadel,
intending to fly from Czernova. I throw myself upon
your Highness's mercy."</p>

<p>"It was your duty, Miroslav," returned Barbara, "to
retain your prisoner, even at the hazard of your life. In
taking orders from a foreign sovereign you have committed
an act of treason. Gabor, see that the governor be
kept in the palace here till our return from the cathedral.
We will then decide as to his punishment."</p>

<p>Gabor saluted, and the troop retired with their prisoner.</p>

<p>"The Czar secretly in our city!" murmured Radzivil,
in a tone of dismay. "What is his object?"</p>

<p>"No good to our rule, count," replied Barbara, quietly.</p>

<p>The secret visit of the Czar to Slavowitz, and his act in
releasing the Duke of Bora, had so sinister an aspect that
the hopeful ones among the ministry returned at a bound
to their previous state of doubt. Were they about to witness
a coronation or a dethronement? Was the Czar preparing
to intervene in the ceremony? Would the solemnity
in the cathedral end amid the mockery and the
triumph of the Muscovite faction? With a feeling of pity
they glanced at their fair young ruler, who for her part
showed no sign of fear in this great crisis. They recognized
that if she should fall, she would fall with dignity.</p>

<p>The breakfast ended, and Barbara retired to dress for
the coming ceremony.</p>

<p>Outside, in the wide extent of ground fronting the Vistula
Palace, the long line of the procession was slowly
forming under the direction of marshals and heralds.</p>

<p>Part of the procession consisted of a sort of historic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
pageant; its members, attired in costumes that recalled
every period of Polish history, carried trophies and emblems,
calculated to stir the patriotic enthusiasm of the
populace.</p>

<p>In this pageant Katina Ludovska bore part, by far the
most charming of the maidens present, clad as she was
in a dainty corselet of silvered mail, above a dark-blue
satin skirt flowered with gold. Mounted upon a beautiful
bay, she bore proudly aloft a famous historic memorial,
a standard captured by King Sigismund at the taking
of Moscow, its white silken folds distinctly stamped with
the impress of a bloody hand, a ghastly testimony to the
struggle that had once raged around it.</p>

<p>In riding along the line of the procession, Zabern
stopped and addressed a few words to his affianced.</p>

<p>"Not pasteboard and tinsel, I trust?" he said, with a
smile, and referring to the sword by her side.</p>

<p>"Real steel," replied Katina, exhibiting the blade.</p>

<p>"Good! 'Tis well to go armed on such a day as this.
We shall be fighting for our liberties ere long."</p>

<p>"Death before submission," replied Katina, with a
brave light in her eyes that made Zabern love her the
more.</p>

<p>The din caused by the marching of soldiers, the neighing
of steeds, the rolling of carriage-wheels, the snarling
of silver trumpets, the crisp, sharp word of command
floated upward to Barbara's ears as she sat undergoing
her toilet at the hands of her ladies. She wondered, as
she had wondered many times that morning, how it would
all end, for assuredly no coronation could ever have been
heralded with more sinister auspices than her own.</p>

<p>Partly with a view to picturesque effect, and partly that
the populace along the line of route might have a clear
and uninterrupted view of their princess, it had been decided
that she should proceed to the cathedral mounted
upon a white palfrey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara had been somewhat disposed at first to shrink
from this exposure to public gaze, but had finally consented
to the arrangement, won over by the argument
that as the people would assemble for the express purpose
of seeing her, it would be a disappointment to them to
catch but a glimpse of their ruler through the windows
of a state-coach.</p>

<p>To Radzivil and Zabern had been given the honor of
riding side by side with the princess, though the marshal
cared much less for the honor than for the opportunity
afforded him of exercising guard over her person, since
he was not without apprehension that some fanatic Muscovite
might attempt her life during her progress through
the streets.</p>

<p>The procession was timed to start at ten o'clock, and as
the hour drew near Zabern and the premier rode to the
entrance of the palace, and there waited the coming of
the princess.</p>

<p>The marshal was mounted upon a magnificent black
charger, and made a splendid figure, for he wore the old
picturesque Polish costume, and sparkled with diamonds
from plume to spur.</p>

<p>"And to think," he mused in the interval of waiting,
"to think that Captain Woodville has not yet arrived."</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville?" exclaimed the premier with a
start. "Surely the princess is not recalling him?"</p>

<p>"No, but I am; and his non-arrival is a grave matter
for us. Were the duke still in the Citadel, Woodville's
absence might be borne with equanimity. As it is&mdash;but
here comes the princess. I must defer my explanation."</p>

<p>Punctually at one minute to ten, Barbara appeared at
the entrance of the palace, and descending the marble
stairs, she mounted her white palfrey with the assistance
of Radzivil.</p>

<p>Zabern at the same moment waved his plumed cap, and
immediately a salvo of artillery from the roof of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
palace proclaimed to the waiting populace that the princess
was about to set off.</p>

<p>Amid the roll of drums, the crash of music, and the
pealing of bells from every steeple in the city, the great
brazen gates of the palace gardens were flung wide, and
there rode forth the head of the procession, the Blue
Legion, their lances flashing brightly in the sunlight.</p>

<p>As they moved out, the sight that met their eyes was
sufficient to stir the blood of the most sluggish. The
centre of the road was empty, but the sidewalks were
literally paved with human heads. Every window, balcony,
and roof was alive with spectators. All Czernova
was there, every citizen apparently determined to find a
place somewhere along the line of route. Resolved to
obtain a view somehow of their youthful sovereign, men
could be seen clinging in mid-air to steeples, pediments,
cornices, wherever foothold could be found. From the
ground below to the sky above nothing but human
faces.</p>

<p>"Sword of Saint Michael!" muttered Zabern. "A
pity all have not been trained to use the rifle. We might,
then, make good defence, even against the Czar's one
hundred thousand."</p>

<p>As soon as Barbara made her appearance, she was
greeted with frenzied cheering. Roar after roar rent the
air. Rolling along the boulevard, and mounting upward
to the sky, the sound was almost loud enough to be heard
in the distant camp of the Czar. So great was the enthusiasm
that the troops lining the streets could with difficulty
prevent the populace from pressing forward to
touch her.</p>

<p>If any dissentients to her rule were present along the
line of route, they were careful to dissemble their feelings.
But who could dissent from a maiden so sweet and fair?
Dressed simply in white silk, she looked every inch a
princess. Her dark hair was without covering, save for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
a slender gold diadem, from which there flowed behind
a veil of diaphanous lace.</p>

<p>Tears glistened in eyes that had not been wet for years.</p>

<p>Aged men who had seen the great Kosciusko carried
off from the fatal field of Macicowice; veterans who,
like Zabern, had marched with Napoleon to the fall of
Moscow; fugitives from Siberian mines, with bodies
scarred by the iron fetters they had worn; Polish patriots,
survivors of the ill-starred rising of '30&mdash;all were
gathered that day in the Czernovese capital to acclaim
one destined, so they believed, to revive the ancient empire
of Poland. Many a salute did Zabern give, as from
time to time he caught sight among the crowd of the face
of some old familiar-in-arms.</p>

<p>Barbara, however, though smiling sweetly upon all
around, was inwardly unhappy. A secret voice seemed
to whisper, "Deceiver! this tribute of loyalty is offered
to Natalie Lilieska, the lawfully born daughter of the
Princess Stephanie, and not to the Barbara of doubtful
origin."</p>

<p>It was too late now to recede from the <i>rôle</i> she had
assumed, and so amid shouting multitudes she rode on,
her progress from the palace to the cathedral being one
continuous scene of triumph, unmarred by anything of a
hostile character.</p>

<p>"It is here, then, that we are to look for the Czar's
<i>coup</i>?" muttered Zabern, as the cavalcade drew in sight
of the stately Gothic cathedral of Saint Stanislas, from
every tower of which silver-tongued bells were pealing
jubilant carillons.</p>

<p>Those in the procession whose duty or privilege it was
to enter the cathedral, made their ingress by various
doors to their appointed places; the less fortunate remained
drawn up in order around the edifice.</p>

<p>As Zabern stood upon the broad flight of steps, carpeted
with crimson velvet, and surveyed the vast crowds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
around, his attention was suddenly arrested by the sight
of a horseman at the far end of a boulevard which opened
upon the cathedral square. As this avenue was kept clear
by the military for the return journey of the princess,
there was nothing to impede the rider's progress, and on
he came with flying rein and bloody spur.</p>

<p>"A courier! a courier!" cried the people, instinctively
divining that he was the bearer of weighty tidings. "What
news? What news?"</p>

<p>To their cries, however, the rider remained mute.</p>

<p>"By heaven, it's Nikita!" muttered the marshal.</p>

<p>As the quivering steed drew up at the foot of the cathedral-stairs,
Zabern sprang to meet his orderly.</p>

<p>"Now, marshal," said the latter, "play the Roman,
and fall on your sword's point, for the end has come."</p>

<p>"A good many men shall fall by this blade ere it
reaches my heart," growled Zabern. "What new trouble
do you bring?"</p>

<p>"The chanting of the monks hath ceased; or to be
plainer, the Russian standard is floating over the Convent
of the Transfiguration."</p>

<p>"Speak you from hearsay merely?"</p>

<p>"I speak of what I have seen."</p>

<p>"The cardinal laughs at us from hell; this is the first
result of his letter. The Russian invasion has begun,
then? Pretty generalship on the part of Dorislas to let
the enemy steal thus upon his rear! And where are the
monks, that they have not fired the powder-magazine, and
sent themselves and their foes flying into the air? They
have sworn an oath to do it rather than let the convent
fall into the hands of the enemy. There would not now
have been one stone upon another if old Faustus had been
there."</p>

<p>"It was when on my way back from the camp of Dorislas
that I caught sight of the Muscovite standard on
the tower of the convent. I immediately rode near and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
perceived the bayonets of the Paulovski Guards moving
to and fro along the battlements. And who should be
in command there but Baron Ostrova, the duke's former
secretary&mdash;he whom the princess banished from Czernova.
I at once galloped back to our camp with the news.
Dorislas instantly set off with a thousand men; he has
invested the convent; his artillery are ready planted for
shelling the place, and he now awaits orders from you."</p>

<p>"'Orders'?" repeated Zabern with contempt. "My
orders should be, 'Consider yourself cashiered for incompetence.'
How many Russians do you suppose there
are in the convent?"</p>

<p>"I cannot state the number, marshal&mdash;sufficient evidently
to overpower the monks, and to hold the place in
case of siege."</p>

<p>"And the rest of the Czar's forces?"</p>

<p>"Are abiding quietly in their camp on the other side of
the frontier."</p>

<p>"Gladly would I come, Nikita, to direct operations, but
that I dare not leave the side of the princess, for there is
more danger to be apprehended here than before the convent.
Dorislas shall see me with all speed as soon as the
coronation is over. Meantime here are his orders."</p>

<p>And the marshal wrote upon a slip of paper: "Maintain
cordon till my arrival. Do nothing unless attacked.&mdash;ZABERN."</p>

<p>Taking the note, Nikita rode off, his breakneck pace
along the boulevard again exciting the wonder of the
populace.</p>

<p>"This holding of the coronation while the foe is on
Czernovese ground might seem a jest to some," murmured
Zabern; "yet if, as I am hoping, the ceremony
should tempt the Czar to come forward personally to
oppose the princess's rights, then all may yet be well.
Since Nicholas has chosen to make an armed raid upon
our territory, let him not complain if he should find himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
a prisoner of war. And with the Czar in our hands
we shall be masters of the game."</p>

<p>On turning to enter the porch, Zabern was met by the
chief court official, to whom had been committed all the
arrangements connected with the coronation.</p>

<p>"Marshal, the cathedral is full to overflowing, and yet
there are hundreds at the northern porch clamoring for
admittance, and all provided with proper orders."</p>

<p>"Very bad arrangement on your part."</p>

<p>"Not so, marshal. The tickets issued did not exceed
the seating accommodation."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Zabern, alive to the significance of this
statement; "you mean that there are several hundred
persons within who have no right to be there?"</p>

<p>"That is so, marshal. The whole body of the northern
transept is filled with men who, I am certain, have gained
entrance by means of forged orders. Among these men I
recognize many Muscovites, not ruffians from Russograd,
but Muscovites of the nobler and wealthier class."</p>

<p>"So!" murmured Zabern. "Their plot of the barricades
having been forestalled and thwarted, the enemy
are resorting to new man&oelig;uvres."</p>

<p>"Some are in uniform, and some in court dress, and
hence they are armed with swords. If we should attempt
to expel them there will be opposition, tumult, possibly
bloodshed. What's to be done?"</p>

<p>"At present, nothing. Let us, if possible, avoid a riot.
If they choose to remain orderly, good; but if it be their
object to oppose the coronation by armed force, then their
blood be upon their own heads."</p>

<p>"And the multitude at the northern porch?"</p>

<p>"Will have to remain there, I fear," replied Zabern,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>He passed from the porch to the interior of the
edifice.</p>

<p>The scene within fairly dazzled the eye. The rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
dresses of the ladies, the splendid military costumes of
the men, formed a picture glowing with color; on all
sides were to be seen the sparkle of jewels and the gleam
of scarlet and gold.</p>

<p>As Zabern slowly made his way towards his allotted
seat in the choir, he did not fail to notice certain mocking
glances cast at him by the occupants of the northern
transept. Mischief was evidently the object of their assembling;
but inasmuch as they were inferior in number
to the Poles present, and as a word on his part could
instantly set in motion the military both inside and outside
the cathedral, Zabern viewed this Muscovite gathering
without any alarm.</p>

<p>The chancel, elevated considerably above the general
level of the cathedral-pavement, was the cynosure of all
eyes.</p>

<p>On the altar were the sacramental vessels, the princely
regalia, and the document supposed to be the original
Czernovese Charter, never publicly exhibited, except at
a coronation.</p>

<p>To the left of the altar was an oaken chair in which the
princess would sit, till the time came for her to take her
place on the throne.</p>

<p>Respectively north and south of the altar, and each
vying with the other in splendor of vestment, stood the
two ecclesiastics who were to officiate in the ceremony,
the Greek Archpastor Mosco, and the mitred Abbot
Faustus; the latter a good man, and a stern old patriot,
quite capable, as Zabern had said, of blowing himself
to fragments, if Polish interests should require such
sacrifice.</p>

<p>While Zabern from his place was intently studying the
occupants of the northern transept, under the belief that
the Czar was concealed somewhere among them, a small
door in the left wall of the choir opened, and Barbara
entered, bare-headed, and clothed in her coronation-robe,&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
vestment of purple velvet, bordered with ermine, and
gleaming with pearls. Four ladies attended her as train-bearers.</p>

<p>Awed by the solemnity of the occasion, she was very
pale, and with the glory of the sunlight illumining her
figure as she moved forward with slow and majestic pace,
she seemed to her adherents afar off like a fair vision
from another world.</p>

<p>According to the prescribed ritual, the first part of the
ceremony consisted in reading a chapter from one of the
Four Evangelists, a duty which by previous arrangement
fell to the lot of Mosco.</p>

<p>As soon, therefore, as Barbara had taken her place in
the oaken chair, she glanced at the archpastor as a sign
for him to begin.</p>

<p>Now great importance was attached both by the Poles
and the Muscovites to this reading of the Gospel. The
lection was neither appointed beforehand nor chosen by
the ecclesiastic officiating; it was left to the guidance
of chance, or rather, as the Czernovese themselves believed,
to the will of the Deity. The lector, following a
usage of mediæval times, was required to open the holy
volume at random and to read the first chapter upon
which his eye should happen to light. It was believed
that the portion thus hit on would contain something applicable
to the person crowned or even prophetic of the
character of the reign.</p>

<p>As Mosco with dignified bearing moved to the lectern,
he passed close to Zabern, whose quick ear instantly detected
a peculiar sound beneath the archpastor's brocaded
and jewelled cassock,&mdash;a sound which the marshal could
liken only to the trail of a steel scabbard.</p>

<p>"As I live the fellow is armed," he muttered. "A holy
prelate with a sword beneath his gown! There's treason
here."</p>

<p>Zabern's first impulse was to spring up, and tearing off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
Mosco's gown, to expose him to the assembly as an armed
conspirator.</p>

<p>It might be, however, that, like himself, the archpastor
anticipated that there would be rioting and fighting
at the coronation, and hence he had as much right as
others to carry arms for his own defence.</p>

<p>Zabern therefore refrained from violence, but his keen
eyes were attentive to every movement of Mosco.</p>

<p>On the brazen lectern, which stood upon the edge of
the choir, directly facing the assembly, lay a volume of
the Four Evangelists, closed and clasped.</p>

<p>Mosco unfastened the clasp, and then evidently wishing
to be thought clear of all suspicion of designedly choosing
his lection, he turned away his head, and with nimble
fingers threw open the volume; and yet in spite of this,
Zabern was impressed with the belief that the Greek prelate
knew beforehand at what page the book was open.
He had not forgotten that this reading of the Gospel had
been selected by Mosco himself as his part in the coronation-ceremony,
and he recalled the archpastor's peculiar
smile at the time of his choosing the office. Was the
mystery about to be solved?</p>

<p>Turning his eyes upon the opened volume, Mosco
began to read. The lection obtained by this <i>sors sacra</i>
proved to be the opening chapter of the Fourth Gospel.</p>

<p>With a curious anticipatory interest the assembly listened
to the reading, prepared to catch at any verse which
might be twisted into some allusion to the princess and
her reign.</p>

<p>Mosco, in a magnificent bass voice and with majestic
delivery, read through five verses. Then, making a momentary
pause, he resumed, changing his tone to one of
peculiar emphasis,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'<i>There was a man sent from God whose name was
John</i>&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"And there he is!" cried a voice that rang like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
clarion all over the cathedral, the voice of Feodor Orloff;
"there he is! John, Duke of Bora. People of
Czernova, listen to the voice of God."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the words been spoken when the Duke of
Bora was seen emerging from the northern transept.

<p>The sudden utterance of Count Orloff, combined
with the simultaneous appearance of the Duke
of Bora, caused an electric thrill to pervade the
cathedral.</p>

<p>The holy Gospels, appealed to by a method approved
by both factions alike, seemed to have given a mandate
in favor of the duke, to the confusion of the adherents of
the princess. The occupants of the northern aisle, as well
as of the northern transept, gave instant proof of the side
on which their sympathies lay. They rose to their feet
as one man, and ignoring the sacred character of the
place, gave vent to tumultuous cries.</p>

<p>"The holy oracles are on our side!"</p>

<p>"They bid us elect a man, and not a woman!"</p>

<p>"A John, and not a Natalie!"</p>

<p>"One sent from God, and not from Rome!"</p>

<p>"Bora, Bora! Give us Bora! The duke is our ruler!"</p>

<p>Their voices immediately became lost in the overwhelming
shouts of the Poles, who likewise rose to their feet,
and replied by counter-cries.</p>

<p>"The princess! the princess! We will have none but
Natalie Lilieska!" There was not a shadow of doubt in
Zabern's mind that the assembling of the Muscovites in
the northern transept, the apt lection of Mosco, the utterance
of Orloff, and the sudden appearing of the duke
were all parts of a preconcerted arrangement.</p>

<p>"Holy hireling of the duke!" he said, grinding his
teeth and addressing Mosco, "you have done your work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Stand from the choir, or by heaven!" he continued, half
unsheathing his sabre, "I'll add a martyr to the Russian
calendar."</p>

<p>"Thou hast the wisdom of the serpent, marshal, though
scarcely the innocence of the dove," sneered the archpastor,
who had many an old score to settle with Zabern.
"We will see if thy wit can get the better of this situation.
No Catholic ruler in Czernova!"</p>

<p>And directing a glance of scarcely disguised hatred
towards the princess, he withdrew from the choir and
took his station among the Muscovites.</p>

<p>Amid wild excitement the Duke of Bora, his face somewhat
pale, continued to advance till he reached the open
space fronting the choir, where he stood visible to all in
the cathedral.</p>

<p>His outward appearance was sufficiently indicative of
the power upon which he relied for support, for he was
clad in the grand uniform of a marshal of the Seminovski
Guards, and carried on his breast the cross of Saint Andrew,
the blue riband of Russia.</p>

<p>At his approach the princess rose from her seat. The
two factions perceiving her action, and curious to learn
what she would say, ceased their raging.</p>

<p>"Marshal Zabern," cried Barbara in a voice that
sounded like music after the raucous clamor of the previous
few moments: "I call upon you to re-arrest that
escaped prisoner, and to conduct him to the Citadel."</p>

<p>"You threaten me with imprisonment?" exclaimed
Bora with a stern air. "It is mine to threaten, and yours
to fear. People of Czernova," he continued, turning from
the choir to address the assembly, "hear a revelation,
strange yet true. She who sits there has no right to the
crown, inasmuch as she is not Natalie Lilieska, but an
impostor bearing a marvellous resemblance to that princess.
The true Natalie died in Dalmatia more than two
years ago."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span></p>

<p>The duke's words destroyed Zabern's lingering hope
that Ravenna's letter might have miscarried, for how had
Bora become possessed of his present knowledge, except
through the medium of the cardinal's dove?</p>

<p>"Marshal Zabern," continued the duke, pointing to
Barbara, "I call upon you to arrest an impostor who
usurps my throne."</p>

<p>"And you may call," replied Zabern.</p>

<p>The duke's statement drew derisive laughter from the
Poles; it was too absurd for belief, a malicious invention
of a disappointed suitor. At this point Polonaski the Justiciary,
who occupied a seat directly fronting the choir,
arose and addressed the princess.</p>

<p>"Lady," he began, and showing by that word that he,
too, like Mosco, had taken the side of her enemies, "lady,
you have heard the duke's accusation. Let this assembly
learn from you whether the charge be true."</p>

<p>It was hard for a youthful and spirited princess to be
catechised by a minister who had suddenly turned against
her.</p>

<p>"Your Highness, do not answer the traitorous gray-beard,"
said Zabern.</p>

<p>For a moment only did Barbara hesitate.</p>

<p>"It is true that I am not Natalie Lilieska."</p>

<p>An earthquake rocking the cathedral-pavement could
not have dismayed the Poles more than had this startling
acknowledgment. True it must be, since she herself admitted
the impeachment,&mdash;an impeachment fatal to her
own interests. And if she must cease to be princess, what
would become of them under the rule of Bora?</p>

<p>The Muscovites, themselves bewildered with the unforeseen
turn taken by events, sat as silent as the Poles.</p>

<p>"Consider well what you say," observed Polonaski
with a slight smile of triumph. "You dethrone yourself
by that statement."</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Barbara. "So long as I should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
lived, the Princess Natalie could not have reigned; inasmuch
as I am her elder sister Barbara, and therefore
lawfully entitled to the throne."</p>

<p>The Poles raised a shout of applause; though somewhat
dubious as to the truth of Barbara's statement, they
were prepared to welcome it, as well as any other device
which might deliver them from the power of the duke.</p>

<p>"Barbara Lilieska," returned the Justiciary, "is a person
of whose existence Czernova has hitherto been ignorant.
Princess Stephanie, wife of the late Thaddeus, had
but one daughter, Natalie."</p>

<p>"I am the daughter of an earlier marriage."</p>

<p>"You bring strange tidings to our ears. It was never
known in Czernova that Prince Thaddeus was twice
wedded. Have you proof of this former marriage?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Barbara, inspired by a sudden thought,
"I will cite yourself, Polonaski, as a witness, for at the
time of my father's demise you were present with other
ministers in the death-chamber. You can testify that
Prince Thaddeus handed the diadem to me with the
words: 'To you, my daughter lawfully born, do I bequeath
this crown, to be held for the weal of Czernova.'
Do you mark the words 'lawfully born'? Ill would my
sire merit his title of 'The Good' if he died in the utterance
of a lie. And what I have received, that will I keep."</p>

<p>The thunders of Polish applause in no way disconcerted
the calm and forensic Polonaski.</p>

<p>"The word of the dying prince is not legal proof," he
answered. "And, moreover, lady, you yourself, in concealing
your own identity and in taking the name of another,
have given clear evidence of disbelief in the claim
that you now put forward."</p>

<p>"People of Czernova," said the duke, raising his voice,
and again addressing the assembly, "I affirm that she
who calls herself Barbara Lilieska was not born in lawful
wedlock, but is a natural daughter of the late Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Thaddeus, and as such is debarred from the succession.
In the days of old," he continued, "when Czernova was
a palatinate, the palatine at his investiture, was always
prepared, either in person or by deputy, to defend his
rights with the sword, nor was the rite discontinued when
the palatines became princes and the investiture a coronation.
I invoke the ancient law of the land and claim
the ordeal of battle. I demand that the princess, so-called,
shall meet me by deputy in single combat. There
is my gage," he added, flinging his leathern gauntlet upon
the flagstone of the choir. "Let the sword decide between
us."</p>

<p>A triumphant laugh arose from the Muscovites. Where
was the champion who would face the duke's deadly
blade? Not even Zabern durst pick up that glove. Willingly
would he have sacrificed his life in the cause of
the princess, but death in this case would mean her
deposition.</p>

<p>"The stars in their courses fight against Czernova,"
muttered Zabern, clenching his one and only hand.
"Long ago, foreseeing this challenge would be given, I
provided, as I thought, for the event. And now we must
decline the combat, for our swordsman," he added in despair,
"our swordsman is absent."</p>

<p>"It is now eleven," remarked Polonaski. The cathedral
clock was chiming as he spoke. "The princess must
appoint her champion within an hour from the giving of
the challenge, the duel itself to take place upon the same
day as the challenge. So runs the statute."</p>

<p>The mild and pacific Radzivil had beheld with indignation
the casting down of the duke's glove.</p>

<p>"What a return to barbarism is this," he cried, addressing
the Justiciary, "to make the crown of Czernova dependent
upon the result of a duel! The statute which
you cite is five hundred years old. It is obsolete, quite
obsolete."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span></p>

<p>"By your favor," replied Polonaski, cool and judicial
as ever, "permit me, as the highest legal authority in
Czernova, to affirm that as that law is still on the statute-book
it is therefore valid and of good effect."</p>

<p>"Your contention is null and void," said Zabern, "inasmuch
as the Diet has passed a law against duelling."</p>

<p>"Against ordinary duelling&mdash;true; but the recent
statute contains no clause against the coronation-combat,
which, therefore, stands as part of the law of the land."</p>

<p>"The ex-Justiciary," said Barbara, deposing him from
his office by a word, even as he had deposed her by a
word, "the ex-Justiciary, as the interpreter of the law,
should know that a traitor has no legal standing. The
duke has shown himself a traitor to the state, and is therefore
not in a position to impugn his sovereign."</p>

<p>"No court of justice has yet proved him to be a
traitor," replied the inflexible Polonaski. "We cannot
accept the word of even the lawful sovereign as the voice
of the law, still less the word of an usurper."</p>

<p>"An usurper and a harlot's daughter," cried the voice
of Orloff from amid the Muscovite ranks.</p>

<p>At this a deep murmur of indignation ran through the
Polish part of the assembly.</p>

<p>"Men of Czernova," cried a woman's voice, "do you
sit thus inactive, letting your princess be opposed and insulted
by the Czar's hirelings? Where is the ancient spirit
of the Poles fled? Would our forefathers have won this
banner if they had shown the timidity that you now
show?"</p>

<p>All eyes turned towards the speaker, who was none
other than Katina Ludovska. Standing high upon a seat
in the centre of the nave, she was plainly visible to all in
the cathedral. While speaking she shook out the silken
folds of the standard she had carried in the procession,
and with her drawn sword pointed to the stamp of the
bloody hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span></p>

<p>Her action was well understood by the Poles. What
their fathers had done they could do. Her gesture was a
tacit incentive to rise, to give battle to the Muscovites,
and to sweep them from the cathedral. In silver helm
and corselet Katina stood aloft, looking like some fair
Amazon of ancient days. With eyes starry with patriotic
fire, she waved the standard, and began to sing in a firm,
sweet voice that penetrated to the most distant part of the
cathedral,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Boja ro-dzica dziewica</p>
<p>Bojiem wslavisna Marya&mdash;"</p>
</div>

<p>A wave of emotion thrilled the assembly as these words
fell upon their ears.</p>

<p>"The old Polish battle-hymn!" muttered Zabern. "By
God, there'll be slaughter now."</p>

<p>It was indeed the famous hymn of Saint Adalbert, the
anthem accustomed to be sung in old time by the Poles
when moving forward to battle, the pæan that has struck
terror to the heart of Muscovite, Tartar, and Turk in
those brave days when Poland was the bulwark of Christendom
against the barbarism of the East.</p>

<p>The memory of their past glories fired the blood of
every patriot in the cathedral to an enthusiasm bordering
on frenzy. Moved by a simultaneous impulse, the whole
body of Poles sprang to their feet, drew their swords, and
began to join in the refrain; and Katina's voice was immediately
drowned in one grand outpouring.</p>

<p>The sparkle of a thousand sword-blades waving in the
iridescent light cast by richly stained glass, the coloring
and splendor of dresses and jewels, the magnificent roll
of voices beneath the lofty Gothic arches, the notes of the
organ pealing high above the chant&mdash;for the organist,
catching the fire of patriotism, was pressing the keys of
his instrument as he had never pressed them before&mdash;were
sights and sounds that baffle description. Strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
men sang with tears in their eyes, and women fainted
with emotion.</p>

<p>Now, as previously stated, the Muscovites occupied the
northern aisle and its adjacent transept, a narrow space
only separating them from the Poles in the nave. Across
this division the two factions glared fiercely at each other;
threats were uttered; challenges interchanged; and when
the Muscovites in turn began to raise the Russian National
Anthem the berserker spirit of the Poles broke
forth.</p>

<p>"Down with the Muscovites!"</p>

<p>"Sweep them from the cathedral!"</p>

<p>"The princess forever!"</p>

<p>"No. Duke of Bora!"</p>

<p>Katina herself, skilled in the use of the sword, was the
first in the fray, the standard still held in her hand.</p>

<p>"Take to your guard, knouter of women!" she cried,
singling out her old enemy, the ex-governor of Orenburg.</p>

<p>Her example found ready imitators, and in a moment
more the clash of steel went ringing down the northern
aisle.</p>

<p>Half-a-dozen Muscovites, sword in hand, sprang forward,
and facing outwards, formed a protecting circle
around the person of the duke, who, for his part, stood
with folded arms, a passive and silent spectator of the
wild work that was taking place.</p>

<p>Zabern, desirous of defending Katina, drew his sabre
and endeavored to force his way through the two opposing
lines to the place where the red-handed banner waved
like a rallying beacon above the flashing points of steel.</p>

<p>Barbara rose to her feet and gazed with grief upon a
scene, the like of which, though rarely witnessed in modern
times within the hallowed interior of a cathedral, was
familiar enough in the old Byzantine days when the election
of a bishop had often to be decided by an appeal to
arms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span></p>

<p>She was in the act of bidding Radzivil summon the
military to part the combatants, when a sudden and striking
apparition rendered the command unnecessary.</p>

<p>"Down with your arms!"</p>

<p>The voice in which these words were uttered rose like
thunder above the <i>mêlée</i>, compelling even the two long
lines of combatants to pause and turn their eyes towards
the speaker. On the edge of the choir, and with hand
uplifted, stood a stately figure clothed in a brilliant and
imposing uniform, a figure half a head taller at least than
the usual height of men, and standing as he did upon the
elevated pavement of the choir, his stature seemed more
than human.</p>

<p>Though few in the cathedral had ever before seen this
personage, yet all recognized in a moment the superb
brow, the severe, haughty features, the dark eyes always
melancholy, even when the mouth smiled.</p>

<p>"The devil himself at last!" murmured Zabern, a grim
joy stealing over his face. "Now have the saints delivered
him as a hostage into our hands!"</p>

<p>The stranger's form seemed really to dilate, as, with
the voice of one born to command, he again cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Down with your arms!"</p>

<p>Furious conspirators, advancing to slay, had once been
awed and checked by that lofty voice, that majestic presence,
which did not fail now to produce a remarkable
effect.</p>

<p>"The Czar! the Czar!" cried the Poles.</p>

<p>"The little father! the little father!" cried the
Muscovites.</p>

<p>The fighting ceased. The assailants on each side fell
back. Slowly the tumult died away in utter silence. The
wounded repressed their groans; for wounded there
were; many, too, brief as had been the combat; and one
man lay dead upon the pavement, slain by the hand of a
woman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span></p>

<p>The Czar, for it was in truth the mighty Nicholas,
turned his face slowly round upon all sides. The fiercest
of the Poles felt compelled to sheathe his blade and to resume
his seat as that terrible eye fell upon him. Who
durst continue to assail a Muscovite with the lord of the
Muscovites looking on, even though that lord were without
a single guard?</p>

<p>It was somewhat mortifying to Barbara's pride that the
cessation of the strife should have been caused by the
authority of the Czar rather than by her own, since it
seemed to place him upon a higher plane than herself.
Clearly he had prevented a massacre of her Muscovite
subjects, and thus far thanks were due to him. But Barbara
was in no mood to offer courtesies to one who had
always shown himself a bitter enemy. The very authority
now assumed by him was an infringement of her own,
and put her instantly upon her mettle.</p>

<p>Among the combatants there was one at least who retained
an undaunted mien, namely, Katina. She advanced
towards the choir, wiping her reddened blade
upon the silken standard, which during the fray had
become detached from the staff.</p>

<p>At the edge of the choir Katina knelt.</p>

<p>"Seek not pardon of me," exclaimed the Czar loftily,
mistaking her purpose. "You who commenced the fray,
you who have slain one of my own subjects!"</p>

<p>"The stars shall fall from heaven ere Katina Ludovska
craves pardon of Nicholas Paulovitch," scornfully replied
the Polish maiden, ever mindful of the fact that the warrant
condemning her to receive the knout was signed with
this same name, Nicholas Paulovitch. "Your Highness,"
she continued, still on her knees, and addressing Barbara,
"if through zeal I have wrought amiss in slaying one
who traduced the fair name of my princess, of you alone
I crave pardon."</p>

<p>"If the name of him whom you have slain be Feodor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
Orloff," said Barbara, "then have you done a good deed,
and you need ask pardon of none."</p>

<p>A Russian governor slain in the very presence of the
Czar, and the princess justifying the deed! Barbara's
ministers sat completely dumfounded by her boldness.
There were two sovereigns in the choir, each contending
for the mastery; which would prevail?</p>

<p>Turning to the emperor with an air of dignity and self-possession,
Barbara said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let the Czar explain by what right he has set free a
traitor imprisoned by my authority."</p>

<p>Such language as this was new to the autocrat, who
is credited with the saying, "Let there be no will in
Russia but that of the Czar." He glanced with surprise,
not unmixed with admiration, at the young girl who faced
him so spiritedly.</p>

<p>"What gives you such boldness in the presence of the
Czar?"</p>

<p>"The Charter of your ancestress Catherine."</p>

<p>"Catherine, 'tis true, granted to the palatines of Czernova
the title of princes, but conferred no independence
upon them. The story of the Charter is a myth."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty may see upon the altar here the identical
document itself, signed by the hand of the empress."</p>

<p>"That," replied Nicholas, scarcely deigning to turn
his eyes in the direction indicated, "that document is a
forgery, as Marshal Zabern can prove."</p>

<p>"I plainly see that a little bird has been whispering to
him," murmured Zabern to himself.</p>

<p>A scornful repudiation trembled upon Barbara's lips,
but it died away when she beheld Zabern's grave
look.</p>

<p>"Marshal, is not that the original Charter of Catherine?"</p>

<p>There was something so wistful and pathetic in her
expression&mdash;an expression which plainly said, "Let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
know the worst,"&mdash;that Zabern felt he could no longer
deceive her.</p>

<p>"It is a faithful transcript, so please your Highness."</p>

<p>Barbara understood the significant reply. Zabern, in
describing to her the plot formed by Bora and Orloff for
the destruction of the Charter, had represented the scheme
as resulting in failure. She now perceived that from pity
the marshal had kept the terrible truth from her, endeavoring
to repair Czernova's loss by means of a forged
document. Wrong of him, doubtless, but the fault lay
more with those whose wickedness had compelled him to
resort to such a policy.</p>

<p>Outwardly Barbara was as firm and as brave as ever,
but inwardly she felt that her throne was going, nay, had
gone from her. And bitter indeed was it to see the crafty
flourishing in their craftiness.</p>

<p>She beckoned Zabern to her side.</p>

<p>"So, marshal," she whispered sadly, but not reproachfully,
"you have deceived me."</p>

<p>"With good intent, your Highness."</p>

<p>"Is forgery good?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in this case. Do you blame me, princess, for
seeking to maintain the liberties of Czernova?"</p>

<p>"Ill would it become me to blame you, Zabern, especially
at such time as this."</p>

<p>She turned from him to listen to the Czar, who seemed
to be addressing herself and the assembly in common.</p>

<p>"The marshal," he said, "dare not uphold the genuineness
of the document upon the altar. It is now manifest
that Czernova can show no valid title to the autonomy it
has so long exercised. It is an integral part of the Russian
dominion, and to-day we resume our usurped authority.
As sovereign-lord of this principality we declare
the claim of the present occupant of the throne to be null
and void."</p>

<p>"On what ground?" inquired Radzivil.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span></p>

<p>"On the ground alleged by the duke&mdash;illicit birth."</p>

<p>Zabern marked Barbara's look of humiliation, and
thought it not amiss to give the emperor <i>quid pro quo</i>.</p>

<p>"A difficult matter this proving of one's legitimacy,"
he observed, turning to the assembly as if taking them
into his confidence. "I have even known emperors to be
in doubt as to the true name of their grandfathers."</p>

<p>This allusion to the frailties of Catherine drew a terrible
look from the Czar. He even laid hand upon his
sword; but, checking his wrath, he resumed his speech
to the assembly.</p>

<p>"And though in the strict view of the law the Duke of
Bora be the rightful ruler of this principality, yet we, as
suzerain, in the exercise of our clemency will permit the
princess so-called to retain her throne, provided she can
produce a champion who shall overcome the duke in
armed combat."</p>

<p>"Then the duke's challenge meets with your Majesty's
approval?" said Radzivil.</p>

<p>"As suzerain," replied the emperor, "it is my duty to
uphold the usages and institutions of the principality;
and the Justiciary&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ex-Justiciary," corrected Barbara quietly.</p>

<p>"We will not quarrel as to that. It is enough that the
highest legal authority here present has affirmed that the
duke's action is in entire assonance with the Czernovese
law."</p>

<p>The Czar did not add, as he might have added, that it
was almost certain that the duke would gain the crown
by this arrangement, which was the reason why he, the
Autocrat, had become so suddenly favorable to constitutionalism.
It would be more polite to place his kinsman
Bora upon the throne under the guise of law, than to
install him by force of arms. Europe, then, could not
so easily raise a protest.</p>

<p>"If," said Barbara, addressing the emperor, "if duelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
be so agreeable to your Majesty, on what ground
do you now justify your former demand for the extradition
of the duke?"</p>

<p>Nicholas, little accustomed to be catechised or to give
reasons for his conduct, frowned and was silent.</p>

<p>Zabern laughed.</p>

<p>"Princess, you demand too much in requiring a Czar
to be logical."</p>

<p>"And how," asked Radzivil of the emperor, "how if
we should ignore the duke's claim and should proceed
with the coronation of the princess?"</p>

<p>The Czar's eyes flashed at this defiance of his authority.</p>

<p>"If you will not uphold your own laws, there is a
power upon the frontier that shall compel you to do
so."</p>

<p>Ill-starred Barbara! Publicly stigmatized as illegitimate;
her principality void of its boasted Charter; her
dream of a Polish empire vanished; her own throne of
Czernova forfeited to the duke, inasmuch as it meant
death to any one who should meet him in combat. And
all this occurring in the space of one brief hour upon the
day which she had anticipated as the most splendid of
her life!</p>

<p>Was this to be the end of her triumphal progress
through the shouting crowds of her capital&mdash;doomed
amid the mocking laughter of the Muscovites to quit the
cathedral a discrowned princess, attended by a melancholy
train of fallen ministers?</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;I <span class="smcap">AM</span> princess!" she murmured between her
set teeth. "They shall not drive me from the throne."</p>

<p>But what booted it to resist? There, a few paces off,
and sternly opposed to her, was the master of many
legions, the lord of one-seventh of the globe, who had
but to give the signal, and one hundred thousand troops
would come marching across the border to do his will.
She might have Right on her side, but he had Might, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
bitterly did she realize the saying of the old Norse god:
"Force rules the world; has ruled it; shall rule it."</p>

<p>Zabern, however, fertile in expedients, was not yet reduced
to a state of despair. He had formed the plan of
seizing the Czar as a prisoner of war, and of making his
release conditional upon the cession of autonomy to Czernova.
If Barbara should refuse to sanction this desperate
scheme, well then he, Zabern, would act without her,
finding a higher authority in the interests of the Czernovese.
Much as he revered the princess, if that princess
should refuse to be true to herself, it would behove him
to put the state before the individual.</p>

<p>He was on the point of communicating his design to
Barbara when Polonaski rose to speak.</p>

<p>"The hour is drawing to a close. She who calls herself
princess has but five minutes left in which to appoint
her champion."</p>

<p>At a sign from the Czar the Duke of Bora stepped forward
to renew his challenge.</p>

<p>"Barbara Lilieska," he said amid a solemn hush, "I
call upon you either to resign the crown you have
usurped, or to defend it at the sword's point. Appoint
your champion. My desire is for a man that we may
fight together."</p>

<p>"Have, then, your desire!" cried a firm, clear voice.</p>

<p>All eyes were immediately turned towards the speaker
who had just entered the cathedral by the western porch,&mdash;a
young man with face bronzed as if by eastern suns,
his handsome, athletic figure arrayed in a dark-blue uniform
with silver facings.</p>

<p>"Paul Woodville, by all that's holy!" cried Zabern in
an ecstacy of delight.</p>

<p>"The man who defeated me at Tajapore," murmured
the Czar darkly.</p>

<p>Amid a scene of wild excitement Paul moved towards
the choir, his long cloak hanging gracefully from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
shoulders, his sabre clanking heavily upon the cathedral
pavement.</p>

<p>Barbara, her heart beating wildly, her lips parted in a
smile, half of pride, half of fear, watched him, knowing
for what purpose he was advancing.</p>

<p>Paul reached the edge of the choir, and picking up the
duke's gauntlet, which had lain untouched for an hour,
he tossed it disdainfully against its owner's face.</p>

<p>"Duke of Bora, I will do battle with you to the death
on behalf of the princess."</p>

<p>"One moment, young sir," said Polonaski. "You cannot
nominate yourself. The appointment rests with the
lady. Do you accept this man as your champion?" he
added, turning to Barbara.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" cried Barbara. "This must not be."</p>

<p>A minute previously she had been longing to triumph
over the Czar; now the princess was lost in the woman.
She would rather resign her throne than put Paul's life
to such terrible hazard.</p>

<p>The anguish pictured on her face, her clasped hands,
her form bent forward, attested the state of her feelings
towards the handsome young Englishman. There was
not one person in the cathedral ignorant of the cause of
her emotion. Her love for Paul, and the reason of his
going away, were matters well known to all the Czernovese.
His sudden return at this crisis imparted an additional
interest to a tableau already thrilling.</p>

<p>"By heaven, your Highness must accept him," whispered
Zabern in her ear. "I have tested his swordsmanship
in the <i>salle d'armes</i> with a view to this very event,
and I know that the duke has no chance against him."</p>

<p>Barbara remained silent. A struggle was taking place
in her mind. The high spirit that had sustained her during
the terrible strain of the last twenty-four hours was
beginning to give way. Her crown had never brought
her anything but sorrow. Why not resign it, and depart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
with Paul to his own Kentish home, that home which he
had so often described to her,&mdash;a fair castellated hall
shaded with beech-trees beside a cool lake! Far happier
the life of an English lady than that of a princess ruling
over a semi-barbarous people.</p>

<p>Polonaski had marked Zabern's triumphant smile at
the appearance of Paul, and that smile made him somewhat
uneasy, implying as it did a firm belief in Paul's
ability to overcome the duke.</p>

<p>"Was not Captain Woodville banished from Czernova?"
he asked; "because if so he has no right to be
on Czernovese ground."</p>

<p>"Captain Woodville retired from Czernova of his own
free will," replied Zabern. "The cabinet signed no decree
of banishment against him."</p>

<p>Barbara was still wavering in mind.</p>

<p>"Stick to your throne," growled Zabern.</p>

<p>"To hold it as a vassal of the Czar!" she murmured
faintly.</p>

<p>"Fear not. We'll find a way of defeating his claim
of suzerainty. What! will you desert the faithful Poles
who have so long stood by you? Will your Highness
resign your throne to the duke, a traitor and assassin,
when you have the opportunity of giving him his final
quietus? Who slew Trevisa? Who burnt the Charter?
Who has brought the Russian army within our borders?
Who but the duke? And now will you let him triumph?
Give the word for the duel. Princess, I know, I <i>know</i>,"
he added emphatically, "that Captain Woodville will
come off victorious."</p>

<p>At this point the Czar spoke.</p>

<p>"The princess so-called must either appoint a champion
or prepare to abdicate."</p>

<p>Despair seized the Poles at the thought of being ruled
by Bora,&mdash;Bora, who in his cups had been heard to declare
that when he should come to power, he would harness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
the Polish nobles to the yoke, and compel them to
plough his fields.</p>

<p>Loud murmurs arose at Barbara's reluctance to accept
Paul as her champion.</p>

<p>"Appoint him, your Highness, appoint him," was the
cry.</p>

<p>"Let Captain Woodville slay the duke, and receive the
hand of the princess as his reward," cried Zabern.
"Have I not said?" he added, addressing the assembly.</p>

<p>The cathedral rang with a shout of applause, a shout
that doomed the princely marriage statute to the limbo
of obsolete things. Zabern had voiced the sentiments of
the Poles. Better an untitled Englishman than Bora.</p>

<p>At that moment the first stroke of twelve chimed from
the cathedral clock. Barbara's decision, if given after the
hour, would be too late. To his dismay Zabern saw that
she was on the point of swooning.</p>

<p>"The word, princess, the word!" he cried, almost
savagely.</p>

<p>"Barbara, say the word," pleaded Paul gently.</p>

<p>She looked at him, and was unable to resist the wistful,
earnest appeal of his eyes.</p>

<p>"I accept&mdash;Captain Woodville&mdash;as&mdash;my&mdash;my champion,"
she gasped. "Oh! what have I done?" she
added in the next moment. And as the twelfth stroke
of the clock died away, she swayed helplessly forward
and sank unconscious into Paul's arms. He surrendered
her light form to the care of her attendant ladies, who
immediately bore her away from the choir to the sacristy
which had served as her robing-room.</p>

<p>"Duke of Bora," cried Zabern, with an exultant smile,
"your last hour has come!"
</p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XIX<br /><br />
THE CORONATION DUEL</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span></p>

<p>Those who had come to the cathedral in the expectation
of witnessing an interesting ceremony
were beginning to find that the reality far surpassed
the anticipation.</p>

<p>A series of dramatic episodes had occurred in quick
succession, but the climax of all was now reached when it
became known that the throne of Czernova was to be put
to the hazard of a duel, and a duel that was to ensue
immediately within the walls of the cathedral itself, an
arrangement due to the initiative of Zabern; for, as
according to the statute the combat must take place that
same day, he had proposed that it should be fought at
once upon the open pavement fronting the choir.</p>

<p>"A duel within a cathedral!" exclaimed Radzivil in
amazement.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Zabern coolly.</p>

<p>"This is a consecrated place. The wilful shedding of
blood here is forbidden by the Church."</p>

<p>"Well, let's take the opinion of the Church as expressed
in the person of Faustus."</p>

<p>Now, sad to relate, that mitred abbot dearly loved to
witness a good fight, for he had been a soldier ere adopting
the monastic profession, and the old Adam was still
strong within him.</p>

<p>"This cathedral is holy ground," he began.</p>

<p>"Presumably so," replied Zabern.</p>

<p>"And to maintain the princess's throne and the Latin
faith is a holy deed."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span></p>

<p>"Without doubt."</p>

<p>"Then let the holy deed take place on holy ground."</p>

<p>"My view of the matter."</p>

<p>"But if the shedding of blood should profane a
church&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As the timid allege."</p>

<p>"Then is the place already profaned by the blood of
Orloff."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"Therefore this being now common ground the duel
can take place without occasion of profanation."</p>

<p>"Faustus, thou reasonest well. Gentlemen, we have
heard the voice of the Church. <i>Fiat voluntas ecclesiæ.</i>
Let the combat take place here, and now."</p>

<p>"Good!" commented Paul, who had listened in silence
to this dialogue. "It cannot come too soon."</p>

<p>A remark echoed by the ferocious Bora, confident in
his ability to overcome the other.</p>

<p>Paul now found his hands grasped by those of admiring
ministers, all of whom were anxious that he should
forget how near they had come to banishing him by
public edict.</p>

<p>In the midst of their congratulations Paul was approached
by a lady-in-waiting, who brought word that
the princess desired to speak with him ere the duel should
begin.</p>

<p>"Go to your dalliance," sneered Bora, who had overheard
the message. "It will be your last."</p>

<p>"If your grace will take counsel of an enemy," replied
Paul, "you will seek the ministration of a priest, for you
never needed it more."</p>

<p>There was something in Paul's quiet and confident
manner, something far removed from boasting, that sent
a momentary uneasiness to the hearts of both Bora and of
his imperial patron, the Czar.</p>

<p>Paul followed his conductress to the sacristy, where he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
found Barbara attended by her ladies, who had divested
her of her heavy coronation robes. The pure white of her
silk dress was not whiter than her face at that moment.</p>

<p>At a sign from the princess the attendants withdrew,
leaving her alone with Paul.</p>

<p>"What a pity," murmured one, "if so handsome a hero
should die!"</p>

<p>Barbara rose to her feet, but so great was her emotion
that she would have fallen, had not Paul caught her in his
arms, where she reclined, clinging convulsively to him.</p>

<p>"Oh! Paul, Paul," she murmured, and for a long time
she could do no more than repeat his name.</p>

<p>The sweetness and the pain at her heart! Was this a
meeting or a parting? Her throne, her power, her wealth,
her triumphs in the diplomacy and the Diet were all as
nothing in comparison with her love of Paul. He was her
dearest possession, and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;this clasp of his
arms might be the last! Within an hour his corpse might
be carried out of the cathedral, and the voice of the Czar
would proclaim her downfall, and the accession of Bora.
And what would life be without Paul?</p>

<p>"Do not weep, Barbara," he cried, tenderly stroking
her dark hair. "This day shall prove the brightest of
your life."</p>

<p>But Barbara failed to see how this could be. To her it
would ever remain as the most wretched, for even if she
should triumph over Czar and duke, that would not remove
the reproach of illegitimacy publicly cast in her
teeth. She shivered at the recollection. Of all the incidents
which had happened that day, this&mdash;the imputed
stain on her birth&mdash;had most wounded her pride. Would
she ever be able to disprove the charge? But it was not
the time to be thinking of this now.</p>

<p>"Oh! Paul," she murmured, "it is selfish, it is wrong
of me to hazard your life in this barbarous fashion."</p>

<p>"It is too late to plead now," he answered gravely. "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
have publicly accepted the honor&mdash;for an honor it is&mdash;of
acting as the princess's champion, and not even Barbara
herself shall dissuade me to withdraw."</p>

<p>"But are you certain, quite certain, that you will be
victorious?"</p>

<p>"Try me," said Paul grimly.</p>

<p>"How can I let you do this?" she cried in an outburst
of anguish. "I will resign my crown. We will go away
together to some other land where happiness may be
found. Say 'yes' to this. Oh, Paul, don't&mdash;<i>don't</i> fight.
If you should fall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No fear of that, since your throne depends upon the
issue."</p>

<p>"My throne!" repeated Barbara bitterly. "What
pleasure can it give me now? The Czar has learned that
our Charter is no more. He claims Czernova as part of
his empire. If I should continue to rule I must rule
merely as his vassal. Consider the humiliations to which
I shall be subjected. Is it worth while risking your life
in order to preserve for me a gilded mockery of power?"</p>

<p>How could Paul smile at the prospect presented by her
words? Yet he did, pleasantly and tenderly.</p>

<p>"Sweet princess!" he said, "for princess you are, and
princess you shall remain, take courage." He turned
her beautiful face upward to his own, and gazed into the
depth of her dark eyes, on whose silken lashes the tear-drops
glittered. "During my absence I have worked
for the good of Czernova. I have splendid tidings for
you. Fear no more the machinations of Russia. From
this day forth you are firmly seated upon the throne."</p>

<p>The sudden and unaccountable joy that filled Barbara's
heart at that moment almost effaced the thought of the
coming duel.</p>

<p>"Oh, Paul, what&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That I have accomplished my mission. But ere explaining
let me first dispose of the duke; otherwise when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
the great news which is now on its way reaches Slavowitz,
he may seek to escape in the train of the Czar, which must
not be, for Trevisa's death calls for atonement."</p>

<p>Though full of wonder, Barbara succeeded in repressing
her curiosity, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Paul, you do not wish me to be a witness of this duel?
I mean," she added timidly, "if you think that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I shall fight with better success if you are looking
on? No, Barbara, it is no sight for your gentle eyes.
Remain here till it is over. And do not fear for me," he
continued, kissing her tearful face, "I am more than a
match for the duke. From boyhood upward to excel in
sword-play has been my ambition. Rarely have I let a
day pass without exercise. I can see now that Providence
has been training my arm for this very event."</p>

<p>His words inspired Barbara with a momentary confidence.</p>

<p>"You will succeed, Paul. Heaven will help you, for
you fight in a righteous cause. Oh, are you going? So
soon? Why, we have but just met. Not yet&mdash;not yet.
A minute longer&mdash;one more kiss&mdash;lest&mdash;lest&mdash;it
should be&mdash;the last&mdash;O Paul&mdash;don't go&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;"</p>

<p>He kissed her tenderly, gently removed her clinging
arms, and quitted the sacristy.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bora, who was sitting beside his great
kinsman, the Czar, scowled as Paul made his appearance
in the choir. The dullest imagination could picture the
tender interview that had taken place in the sacristy. All
knew that Paul had come to the combat with Barbara's
kiss dewy on his lips.</p>

<p>"But for yon fellow," muttered Bora, "I might now be
the consort of the princess."</p>

<p>"The fair lady loves power," replied the emperor.
"She may yet consent when she sees the crown on your
brow. See, the herald summons you. Now, Bora, play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
the man, and you are prince by the law of Czernova itself.
All Europe will be unable to dispute the legality of your
title."</p>

<p>The two duellists did not immediately take to the sword
and engage. The coronation-rubric prescribed certain
formalities&mdash;relics of a mediæval usage&mdash;in connection
with the championing of the sovereign; and these a
herald, dressed in the quaint antique costume of his
office, proceeded to carry out.</p>

<p>"Let the champions come forward."</p>

<p>Paul, with a smile serene and high, stepped to the
appointed place, namely, the space fronting the choir.
Sand had been sprinkled upon the pavement to absorb
the blood that might be shed, and to prevent the combatants'
feet from slipping.</p>

<p>Bora with a scowling brow faced his opponent.</p>

<p>"Do you, Paul Cressingham Woodville, affirm that she
who calls herself Barbara Lilieska is the true and lawful
ruler of this principality of Czernova?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And do you, John Lilieski, affirm that you yourself
are the true and lawful ruler of this principality of
Czernova?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And to prove your respective contentions, are you
each willing to submit to the ordeal of battle?"</p>

<p>The champions signified their assent.</p>

<p>The herald then proceeded to explain the conditions
that were to regulate the combat. Swords of a certain
length were to be the weapons used. From beginning to
end the duel was to be continuous without any interval
for rest or refreshment. Each was to fight till his opponent
should be destroyed, for quarter was neither to be
given nor accepted, and though the life-blood were being
drained from the combatants the wounds were not to be
stanched.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span></p>

<p>By a solemn oath repeated after the herald, each champion
bound himself to observe these regulations. Hence
it was certain that one, possibly both, would not leave the
cathedral alive, a fact which imparted a terrible interest
to the coming combat.</p>

<p>"No quarter! that's a good rule," remarked Zabern
to Katina, who sat beside him. "The craven duke would
be begging for his life, and we want no more Boras in
Czernova."</p>

<p>"The champions will now take their position for the
combat," cried the herald.</p>

<p>The duellist when hard pressed is apt to give way before
his opponent. In the present case, however, advance
or retreat, save within very narrow limits, was rendered
impossible.</p>

<p>Fixed in the stone flooring was a ring of brass designed
for raising a slab that covered a stairway leading to a
crypt below. The right ankle of each combatant was attached
to this same ring by a strong cord six feet in length,
thus confining their movements within a circle of four
yards in diameter.</p>

<p>These preparations raised the interest of the spectators
to a high pitch. A dreadful sensation thrilled the ladies
present as they watched the champions during the process
of cording; the men, more cool and critical, strove to
predict the victor from the physique presented by each of
the opponents.</p>

<p>Judged thus, the advantage seemed to be on the side of
the duke, whose frame was powerful and massive; Paul
was not equal in stature to his antagonist, was of more
slender build, and any superiority derivable from his
greater activity was somewhat nullified by the restraining
cord.</p>

<p>The circumstances attending this combat contributed to
render it unique in the annals of Czernovese duelling.</p>

<p>The one champion, Bora, stimulated by the presence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
his imperial patron, the mighty Czar, fought to gain a
crown; the other, Paul, for the hand of a fair princess.
There was a coloring of romance about the affair strongly
suggestive of the days of chivalry, and this was enhanced
by the quaint character of the ritual employed.</p>

<p>Each of the Czernovese factions was confident of the
success of its champion. The Muscovites boasted of the
duke's thirty duels, from all of which he had emerged
victorious without taking a wound. The Poles had no
such record to show on behalf of their champion; his
brilliant feat in the <i>salle d'armes</i> was unknown to them,
but they had marked Zabern while Paul was lifting the
duke's glove, and they felt that the marshal must have
had good cause for the grim joy that had appeared on his
face. Moreover, Paul's gallant defence of Tajapore was
still fresh in their minds; his triumph over the Czar's
policy in the East was an augury of a similar triumph in
the West, and contributed to give a piquant zest to the
coming duel. At any rate, his cold, flashing eye, compressed
lips and resolute mien showed that he was a dangerous
opponent.</p>

<p>As soon as Paul had removed his coat and vest the
herald placed his hand beneath his shirt.</p>

<p>"To ascertain whether you wear an under-tunic of
mail," he explained in answer to Paul's look of surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you deem me a person of so little honor?"</p>

<p>"This scrutiny is so enjoined by the rubric," remarked
the herald, as he subjected Bora to the same inspection.</p>

<p>The weapons next occupied the herald's attention.</p>

<p>The duke had come prepared for the contest, and hence
his blade was of the length prescribed by the statute;
Paul's sword fell short of this by two inches, and though
he much preferred to fight with his own weapon, the
herald would not permit him to do so.</p>

<p>"My blade is of the requisite length," said Zabern,
"and I can warrant it tried steel. Take it; you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
make it historic. It has already shed the blood of a cardinal;
why not that of a duke? There will be a sort of
poetic justice in despatching the princess's two enemies
with the same weapon."</p>

<p>"You seem very confident, marshal," sneered Bora.</p>

<p>"Very confident, your grace. You see there's no princess
to intervene this time."</p>

<p>The herald having tested the length and flexibility of
Zabern's sword returned it to the marshal, saying, as he
did so,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pierce your skin with the point."</p>

<p>Zabern instantly pricked the palm of his hand till the
blood flowed, while the duke did the like with his own
weapon.</p>

<p>The puzzled Paul looked inquiringly at Zabern, who
explained that it was an old usage in Czernova, adopted
as a precaution against poisoned blades.</p>

<p>The two combatants were now bidden to stand as far
apart as the cords would permit, and each after kissing
his blade held it vertically aloft, repeating after the herald
the following oath,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hear, O ye people, that I have this day neither eaten
nor drunk aught, nor have I upon my person either charm
or amulet, nor have I practised any enchantment or sorcery,
whereby the law of Heaven may be abased, or the
law of Satan be exalted. So help me God and His
saints!"</p>

<p>Very absurd and mediæval, no doubt, but being a part
of the ancient ritual its enunciation was required from
each champion.</p>

<p>The news of the coming duel had been announced to
the populace without, and their cries of excitement contrasted
strangely with the deadly stillness that reigned
within the interior of the fane.</p>

<p>Upon that part of the cathedral roof that overlooked
the square, a group of soldiers could be seen standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
about a flag-staff, at the foot of which were two banners,
one white, the other black. The eyes of all the people
below were set upon this flag-staff, when it became known
that the hoisting of the white standard would signify the
triumph of the princess's champion, and the black standard
his defeat.</p>

<p>The time for the great contest had now come, and the
herald stepped backward a few paces.</p>

<p>"May Heaven defend the right! In the name of God&mdash;fight!"</p>

<p>As the blades clashed together the spectators drew a
deep breath. The time occupied by the preliminaries,
though in reality very brief, had seemed so long that the
beginning of the duel came as an actual relief.</p>

<p>A shiver of expectancy ran around the cathedral. Five
thousand pairs of eyes were riveted upon the choir, and
upon naught else. The loveliest lady present might have
sighed in vain for a single glance.</p>

<p>Abbot Faustus had sunk upon his knees by the altar,
and was now telling his beads, but though his spiritual
eyes might be directed towards heaven, his earthly vision
was certainly fixed upon the two combatants, as Katina
observed to Zabern.</p>

<p>"Well, he can cite Moses as a precedent," remarked
the marshal, as he sat down to watch the fray. Loving a
good fight, Zabern viewed the present spectacle with a
real sense of enjoyment, untroubled by any doubt as to
the result.</p>

<p>The Czar, with his strong liking for everything military,
was likewise in his element. He sat, bent forward,
resting the point of his sabre upon the pavement, and his
hands upon the hilt, prepared to view the display of
swordsmanship with the critical eye of a <i>maître d'armes</i>,
as confident in the triumph of Bora as Zabern was in that
of Paul.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bora, burning to distinguish himself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
the presence of the Czar, and apparently desirous of terminating
the combat in the shortest space of time possible,
made so furious an attack upon Paul that the latter could
do no more than remain on the defensive. So weighty
was the descent of Bora's blade that Paul's arm tingled at
each shock; so swift his tierce that his sabre-point was
often swept aside when within an inch only of Paul's
breast. In truth the eye could scarcely follow the movement
of the blades, which in their rapidity resembled
flashes of light, rather than pieces of steel wielded by
human hands.</p>

<p>The duke pressed his adversary yet harder, compelling
him to recede inch by inch to the end of his tether, a
retrogression which, added to the fact that Paul did not
return the cut and thrust of his opponent, occasioned
grave misgiving in the minds of the Polish spectators.</p>

<p>"Our champion has degenerated since the day he surprised
us in the <i>salle d'armes</i>," murmured the premier in
alarm.</p>

<p>"Bah! my good Radzivil," returned Zabern confidently,
"cannot you see that he is letting the duke exhaust
himself? Bora is rash in thus pouring out his strength
like water. This is too violent to last long. Ah! said
I not so? First blood to us!"</p>

<p>The duke had failed to preserve his guard, and as a
result Paul's weapon had penetrated his side to the depth
of a quarter of an inch, a feat performed with such quickness
that though all were watching, few perceived it.</p>

<p>"The duke is wounded."</p>

<p>"He is not."</p>

<p>Doubt vanished with the appearance on Bora's white
shirt of a small red disk that began slowly to expand.</p>

<p>Zabern smiled grimly at the bewilderment of the duke,
whose air resembled that of a bull in the Spanish arena
when first pierced by the dart of the banderillero&mdash;the
air of amazement as to how the thing could have happened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
mingled with incredulity that any one should have
ventured to play such a trick upon him.</p>

<p>This was the first wound ever received by him in his
character as duellist, and the blow thus given to his prestige
stung the duke far more than the mere physical pain
caused by the stab. Its occurrence, however, at this
stage was timely, for it served to check his fiery conceit
and to teach him caution; it behoved him to guard as
well as to assail.</p>

<p>Paul's vigilance in detecting an error on his adversary's
part raised the spirit of the Poles to a high degree, while
the feeling of the Muscovites underwent a corresponding
depression.</p>

<p>"Good for the Englishman," cried a Pole.</p>

<p>"He is the duke's match," exclaimed a second.</p>

<p>The combat being now waged with more caution on the
part of the duke, there ensued a really brilliant display of
swordsmanship, which, interesting to the civilians, was
far more so to the military officers present, from whom
came subdued murmurs of admiration.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Zabern, conscious that the duke was
now in his best form. "The great Napoleon, with whom
I once dined, made remark to me, 'Scratch a Russ, and
you will find a Tartar.' In the present instance, however,
the scratch seems to have made our Russ more cool."</p>

<p>The Czar, who had overheard these words, so far permitted
his curiosity to overcome his dislike of Zabern as
to ask coldly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where did you dine with Napoleon?"</p>

<p>"Beneath the roof of the Kremlin, sire," replied Zabern,
with an ironical salute.</p>

<p>The emperor repressed his wrath, and turned again to
view the strife.</p>

<p>Every movement of the blades was watched in fear and
trembling by the Polish spectators, who felt that it was a
fight betwixt liberty and despotism; a mortal thrust on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
the part of the duke would leave them but a shadow of
that freedom which they had enjoyed under the <i>régime</i>
of the princess.</p>

<p>Many of the ladies present, unable to endure the sight,
averted their eyes, and then, impelled by a dreadful curiosity,
turned to gaze again. Some looked on with handkerchiefs
pressed to their mouths to check the screams
which might have disconcerted the combatants. Intense
emotion caused a few to swoon away.</p>

<p>The tide seemed to be turning in favor of Paul. He
began to press the duke, whose strength was beginning to
fail. Mighty in a first onset, he lacked the steady endurance
of his adversary. Suddenly, while bending sideways
to avoid a thrust which he had failed to parry, Bora
lost his balance and fell. In falling, his sword flew from
his hand.</p>

<p>And there he was, resting upon one knee, defenceless,
at the mercy of his opponent.</p>

<p>The spirit of chivalry restrained Paul from giving the
fatal stroke.</p>

<p>"I cannot slay an unarmed man," he said.</p>

<p>"What folly is this?" cried Zabern, starting up in
wrath. "Did he spare Trevisa? Would he spare you
if you were now in his place? This is no time for generosity
or mercy. The princess's throne is at stake. Strike
and spare not."</p>

<p>Bora neither moved nor spoke, awaiting his end in
trembling terror. Paul's refusal to strike evoked the
long-suppressed feelings of the Poles.</p>

<p>"Kill! kill!"</p>

<p>The lofty arches rang with excited cries. Even tender
ladies, carried away by the heat of the moment, added
their voices to those of the men. Paul, looking around
upon the assembly, saw nothing but a forest of waving
hands, and a multitude of fierce-gleaming eyes urging
him to the bloody work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span></p>

<p>"No quarter can be granted," said the herald. "You
have each sworn an oath to slay, or be slain."</p>

<p>But inasmuch as Paul was not to be moved from his
purpose, there was no other course left than to permit the
duke to resume the combat.</p>

<p>"You have given him time to recover himself," grumbled
Zabern, as he sat down again. "It is a violation of
the rules."</p>

<p>During his discomfiture, Bora had glanced more than
once at the Czar, as if supplicating his intervention. But
the emperor sat impassive as a statue, ignoring the silent
appeal. Relying on the duke's boastful assurances of
victory, Nicholas had assented to the policy of the duel
as a convenient and constitutional way of deposing the
princess. It now seemed that this plan would fail. Then
let the duke pay the penalty merited by his presumption.
Woe to the man who deceives the Czar! Bora's heart
sank within him at sight of the emperor's cold face.</p>

<p>The contest now entered upon its last, its fatal phase.</p>

<p>Equality had disappeared between the two champions;
the duel was virtually over; the result known to all present;
it was merely a question of time.</p>

<p>And the person most conscious of this was the duke
himself. His confident swagger had vanished. He was
fighting now, not for glory or a throne, but for dear life
itself.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to assail Paul. Why should he?
He could do no more than he had done. He had tried
again and again to reach his adversary, and with graceful
ease Paul had parried each cut and tierce. He could
escape death only by some negligence on the part of his
opponent, but that opponent was too keen to be caught
erring.</p>

<p>Little by little Bora was forced backwards, till at last
further retreat was rendered impossible by the cord attached
to his ankle; yet farther back he must go if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
must avoid that sabre-point, which, swift and deadly as
the tongue of a serpent, glittered continually within an
inch of his face and breast.</p>

<p>His strength was ebbing fast; his arm had grown completely
wearied by the constant parrying; he longed to
throw away his weapon and cry for mercy; but for the
restraining cord he would have cast himself at the feet of
the Czar to implore his intervention. The despair pictured
on his face produced a painful feeling among the
more sensitive portion of the spectators.</p>

<p>With vision continually blurred by the great drops of
sweat that hung from his eyebrows, the duke struggled
on, till at last came the end.</p>

<p>Tempted from his defensive Bora made a sudden
thrust, and his sabre-point entered a tiny orifice in the ornamental
work that formed the cross-guard of Paul's
sword. Lunging with wild vehemence, Bora was unable
to check his impetus, and the result was that the blade of
his weapon instantaneously curved upwards with such
force as to snap in two, while at the same moment Paul's
sabre, darting forward horizontally, entered the duke's
breast, and passed out under his left shoulder.</p>

<p>Bora's arms flew aloft with a convulsive jerk; the
fragment of his blade dropped with a ringing sound upon
the pavement; he gave a strange gasping sigh, and then
his body slid from Paul's blade and lay on the floor in a
huddled heap.</p>

<p>"Now, I call that a very pretty fight," remarked
Zabern.</p>

<p>A long shout of triumph arose from the Poles, followed
a few seconds later by a tremendous roaring from
the populace outside, as the white standard flew up the
flagstaff, announcing the victory of the princess's
champion.

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XX<br /><br />
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span></p>

<p>As the Czar beheld his champion lying dead, a wave
of anger swept over him, suppressed immediately
by his stern fortitude.</p>

<p>"The word of the Czar is sacred," he cried, rising from
his seat and addressing the assembly. "Barbara Lilieska
is Princess of Czernova. Let the coronation proceed."</p>

<p>Paul, released from the cord that had confined him to
the place of combat, here turned and confronted the
emperor.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," he remarked, with a somewhat cold
expression, "ere claiming to exercise suzerainty in Czernova,
will do well to await the arrival of your Foreign
Minister now on his way hither."</p>

<p>The Czar stared haughtily at Paul, having no idea
whatever of his meaning, while Zabern, equally mystified,
murmured,&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the name of the saints, explain your saying."</p>

<p>Paul whispered a few words into the ear of the marshal,
who received the communication with an expression
of incredulity.</p>

<p>"It is true," asseverated Paul. "And," he added,
"here comes the confirmer of my words."</p>

<p>A slight commotion here took place at the far end of
the cathedral, and there entered a man of distinguished
presence whom Zabern immediately recognized as the
Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Then the marshal
no longer doubted. His face became lighted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
an expression of joy, succeeded the next moment by
one of trouble.</p>

<p>"The Convent of the Transfiguration!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"There is our danger. We are lost if our secret documents
fall into the Czar's hands. And how is it to be
prevented with a Russian regiment in possession of the
monastery?"</p>

<p>The newcomer on entering had thrown a quick glance
around, and catching sight of the emperor standing upon
the edge of the choir, he at once made his way to the
imperial presence.</p>

<p>"Count Nesselrode! you here! How is this?" asked
the Czar, perceiving plainly that trouble was in the air.</p>

<p>"A despatch from the Court of St. James's, requiring
your Majesty's immediate attention," replied Nesselrode,
sinking upon one knee as he presented the document.
"On receiving it from the British ambassador, I instantly
set off for Zamoska, travelling day and night; and, learning
on my arrival there that you would be found in the
cathedral of Slavowitz, I have hastened hither. A grave
despatch, your Majesty," he added in a lower tone, "a
despatch affecting this very principality. Hence my haste
to deliver it to you."</p>

<p>The emperor sat down again, broke the seal of the
envelope, unfolded the despatch, and proceeded to read
it with a darkening countenance.</p>

<p>The only person in the cathedral whose eyes were not
set upon the Czar at this particular juncture was Zabern,
who was himself occupied in the reading of two very interesting
documents which had just been put into his
hands.</p>

<p>During the course of the duel there had entered the
cathedral the chief of the Police Bureau, who had personally
taken upon himself to investigate matters relative to
the murder of Cardinal Ravenna. His search in the
archiepiscopal palace had resulted in the finding of certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
papers, so extraordinary in their character that the
police-official felt constrained to hasten at once to Zabern
with the news of his discovery. The sight of the duel
had kept him dumb and motionless, but as soon as it
was over he had hurried to the side of Zabern.</p>

<p>"Marshal," he whispered, "what name did the Czar
give to our princess?"</p>

<p>"Barbara Lilieska. That is her true name, Casimir."</p>

<p>"Then these papers do not depose her?" said the chief
of the police, exhibiting what he had found.</p>

<p>"Depose her?" repeated Zabern, as he ran his delighted
eye over the document. "By the soul of Sobieski,
you could not have brought a more acceptable gift to
her Highness. This will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marshal, is it true that the princess has not yet been
informed of the result of the duel?"</p>

<p>It was Paul who spoke, and he spoke with some
warmth.</p>

<p>"Such have been my orders."</p>

<p>"Why do you prolong her suspense?"</p>

<p>"Who more fitting than the victor himself to convey
the glad tidings? Go. Carry these papers with you.
Tell the princess that they were found in the cardinal's
palace!"</p>

<p>Taking the documents from the hand of Zabern, Paul
proceeded to the sacristy, where he had left Barbara.</p>

<p>She was alone on her knees in prayer. She had
heard the rapturous applause ringing through the cathedral
aisles; she had heard the still louder shout from
the square, and had trembled, knowing that all was
over.</p>

<p>But when moment after moment went by and no one
came with tidings, a black pall of horror fell over her. It
must be that the duke's sword had prevailed, and that her
friends from pity hesitated to come forward with the
truth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened, yet she durst not turn her head.</p>

<p>Through the corridor came the solemn roll of the
organ, and with it the voices of the white-robed choir:
"<i>Deposuit potentes et exaltavit humiles</i>."</p>

<p>Why had Faustus ordered the "Magnificat" to be
sung? Could it be that&mdash;?</p>

<p>"Barbara!"</p>

<p>A delicious feeling of relief thrilled her whole frame
as that word fell on her ear.</p>

<p>She looked up from her knees. Yes, it was the living
Paul, and not his spirit; Paul smiling tenderly, and apparently
unhurt. She tried to speak, but emotion checked
her utterance. Paul raised her drooping figure from the
ground and girdled her in a grasp of iron.</p>

<p>"My sweet floweret. You must not faint. All is well.
Your throne is safe."</p>

<p>"Your life is safe," she faintly articulated, "and that
is all I care for."</p>

<p>Then followed a long interval of silence. Their joy
was too deep for words. At last Barbara spoke.</p>

<p>"And is Bora really dead?"</p>

<p>"May all enemies of the princess be as the duke is."</p>

<p>"And you? Are you not wounded&mdash;hurt?" she
asked, holding him at arm's length.</p>

<p>"There is not a scratch upon me."</p>

<p>"And the Czar&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Is taking a lesson in the school of humiliation."</p>

<p>And here Paul proceeded to relate what he had been
doing during his absence. He had gone away boldly resolved
on making an attempt to persuade the English
Foreign Secretary to interest himself on behalf of Czernovese
liberty.</p>

<p>With this view, then, Paul, on the very first night of
his arrival in London, called at the residence of Viscount
Palmerston, and sent in his card. That statesman had
no sooner read the notable name "Paul Woodville," than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
he gave orders that the visitor should be instantly admitted
to his presence.</p>

<p>He received Paul with great affability, expressing his
regret that a young soldier, certain of promotion, should
have so strangely quitted the service of a great empire
for that of one of the smallest states in Europe.</p>

<p>"You have sadly disappointed the British public," he
remarked with a smile. "We were preparing great
honors for you in England."</p>

<p>"I desire no other honor, my lord," replied Paul,
boldly, "but that England should observe towards my
adopted home that faith to which she stands pledged by
the Treaty of Vienna."</p>

<p>Now it was a point in Paul's favor that Lord Palmerston
had warningly declared from his place in the House
of Commons at the close of the session of '46 that "The
Governments of Austria, Russia, and Prussia, would
recollect that if the Treaty of Vienna was not good on
the Vistula, it might be equally invalid on the Rhine and
on the Po." Therefore he became immediately attentive
when Paul began to hint at an intended violation of this
treaty; ever the friend of nationalities striving to be free,
he listened with considerable warmth and indignation as
his visitor went on to describe the insidious attempts made
by Russia to undermine the independence of Czernova.</p>

<p>At this particular date Russia was the <i>bête noire</i> of
Lord Palmerston, who had long viewed with misgiving
the continual advance of that Power in the direction of
India. He had learned from the despatches forwarded
both by Paul and by other officers, that a considerable
body of Russians had joined the Afghans in the attack
upon the British garrison at Tajapore; but since it could
not be proved that these auxiliaries had acted with the
authority, or even with the knowledge of the Czar's ministry,
the English cabinet had been obliged to let the matter
pass.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span></p>

<p>The affairs of Czernova, however, seemed to afford a
favorable opportunity, both for administering a check to
Russia's growing spirit of aggression, and also of asserting
British authority in the councils of Europe.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when certain of the Continental powers
had been sounded as to their views upon the matter, the
English ministry, after due deliberation, decided to uphold
that clause of the Vienna Treaty which guaranteed
independence to Czernova.</p>

<p>A Queen's messenger carrying the cabinet's decision
was despatched to St. Petersburg. Paul himself had accompanied
this emissary, and after lingering a day or two
by the Neva, had set off for Czernova, so arranging the
stages of his journey that he might reach Slavowitz on
the eve of the coronation. An unforeseen breakdown on
the way had delayed him by twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"The English ambassador at St. Petersburg," he
added, "favored me in confidence with an outline of
'Old Pam's' despatch. Ignoring the Charter altogether,
it declares that Czernova shall continue to exercise that
independence which it has exercised since 1795."</p>

<p>"But," said Barbara, who had listened in breathless
wonder, "to what point is England prepared to go in
order to maintain the integrity of Czernova?"</p>

<p>"To the point of the bayonet, if necessary. The present
despatch, I am given to understand, contains no
threats, but its language, though diplomatically polite, is
quite unmistakable. France, too, is with us in this matter;
the Porte likewise, and the Kingdom of Sardinia.
Therefore, take courage, Barbara. The Czar will not
risk a European war for the sake of Czernova."</p>

<p>For a moment the princess gazed at Paul, admiration,
pride, and love shining from her eyes. Then with
a low, sweet cry of rapture she flung herself into his
arms.</p>

<p>"Paul, you have saved Czernova," she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span></p>

<p>Paul here ventured to call Barbara's attention to the
papers entrusted to him by Zabern.</p>

<p>No sooner did the princess realize the character of the
documents than she gave a second cry of delight. The
one document was a certificate of marriage between Thaddeus
Lilieski, Prince of Czernova, and one Hilda Tressilian;
the other a baptismal certificate of an infant,
Barbara Lilieska, described as the daughter of the aforesaid
Thaddeus and Hilda.</p>

<p>How these documents came into the possession of the
cardinal could only be surmised. Probably he had secured
them prior to springing his plot upon Thaddeus,
conjecturing that the prince, on seeing the claims of his
beloved daughter Natalie threatened, would do his best
to destroy all proofs of Barbara's relationship to himself.
Afterwards, when Thaddeus became anxious to establish
the fact that he had another and a legitimate daughter,
Ravenna had maintained silence respecting these documents,
thinking perhaps that secrecy would be more conducive
to his own interests.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, there the documents were, and their
genuineness was not called in question by the legal experts,
to whose inspection they were afterwards submitted.</p>

<p>Paul, gazing upon Barbara, saw her face "as it had
been the face of an angel." No marvel that she was
filled with an exquisite sense of joy! She was now free
from the imputation of illegitimacy. She could assume
her rightful name instead of masquerading under a false
guise. The sword of Paul had kept her throne from becoming
the prize of the duke; and, thanks to the ægis
of Britain, Czernova was safe from the aggression of
Russia.</p>

<p>Best and sweetest thought of all, there was now no
obstacle to her union with Paul, for who among her ministers
would oppose her marriage with the gallant Englishman
who had saved the principality?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span></p>

<p>The sound of approaching footsteps caused the princess
to withdraw from the arms of Paul; and immediately
afterwards Zabern entered the sacristy, followed by Katina
and by most of the ministry.</p>

<p>"Princess," said Zabern solemnly, and Barbara observed
that there were tears in his eyes; "princess, amid
your joy give a thought to the brave men who have died
to save our secret."</p>

<p>"What mean you, marshal?"</p>

<p>"Early this morning the Convent of the Transfiguration
was seized and occupied by a regiment of the Paulovski
Guards."</p>

<p>"By that act, then, the Czar has violated the Treaty of
Vienna."</p>

<p>"True; but considering what that convent contained,"
said Zabern with a melancholy smile, "we shall act
wisely in ignoring this raid upon our territory, especially
as the Czar has paid the penalty of his act by losing a
splendid regiment. Dorislas, who invested the convent,
has just sent this message."</p>

<p>Zabern handed the princess a note inscribed with the
following words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"At noon convent blew up with tremendous explosion.
Building and inmates reduced to atoms. Some of
our men injured by falling débris, but none killed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dorislas.</span>"</p>

<p>Barbara's face saddened.</p>

<p>"So the monks kept their vow," she murmured, "and
fired the powder-magazine, sacrificing their own lives to
save us from discovery."</p>

<p>"Fortunately your Highness has saved Faustus by inviting
him here to crown you, and yet the old abbot is
grieving because he has not died with the rest of his
brethren."</p>

<p>"Though it be harsh to say it," remarked Paul, "the
destruction of that monastery is, under the present circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
the best thing that could have happened to
Czernova. If it could be proved that the principality is
the nucleus of Polish conspiracies directed against the
Czar's rule, the protecting arm of England will of necessity
be withdrawn. This thought troubled me during
my interview with Lord Palmerston."</p>

<p>"Then we will not abuse the good-will of England,"
commented the princess. "From henceforth I cease to
be a conspirator. My dream of a wider realm is over.
I must leave to others the liberation of Poland," she continued
with a sigh. "But," she added, knitting her
brows, "a conspirator I must be, <i>nolens volens</i>; for have
I not secretly pledged my written word to assist Kossuth
and the Magyars with gold, if not with arms?"</p>

<p>"Your Highness, I am happy to state that the treaty is
non-existent," remarked Radzivil. "The Hungarian envoy
who carried the treaty, while endeavoring to pass the
Austrian frontier in the dark, was detected and chased by
the sentinels; knowing that it meant death to be caught
with the document upon his person, he, seeing his pursuers
gaining upon him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Destroyed the treaty?"</p>

<p>"Effectually, for he <i>ate</i> it."</p>

<p>Barbara smiled sadly as she replied, "Kossuth will
deem me unjust, but I fear there can be no renewal of
the treaty."</p>

<p>"Your Highness," said Radzivil, with a significant
glance at Paul, "the first act of to-morrow's Diet shall
be the repeal of the princely marriage statute."</p>

<p>"But," whispered Zabern to Katina, "since no such
statute bars our way, why should not old Faustus make
us one ere the night come?"</p>

<p>Katina blushed and averted her head. But, be it noted,
she offered no opposition to the marshal's desire.</p>

<p>"Princess," said Zabern, glancing at his watch, "your
coronation has been delayed two hours by the action of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
the duke and the Czar. Your loyal subjects in the cathedral
are beginning to ask whether there is to be any coronation.
Let your Highness resume your place in the
choir, and receive your lawful crown, thus triumphing
in the very presence of the Czar."</p>

<p>The party withdrew from the sacristy, and the ladies
entered to aid the princess in her robing.</p>

<p>As Paul made his appearance in the choir, he was
greeted with a cry which, rolling through the cathedral
and penetrating to the sacristy, caused Barbara's cheek
to color with pride and pleasure. For that cry was&mdash;</p>

<p>"LONG LIVE PAUL, PRINCE OF CZERNOVA!"</p>
